Azeri Political Prisoners PDF Parser

    Purpose

To extract the data contained in the August 2014 version of the Azeri Political Prisoners PDF and organize it in computer-readable spreadsheets (.csv format).


    Descriptions of input files

- azeriPoliticalPrisoners.pdf: The original pdf, found at http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/THE%20LIST%20-%2098%20political%20prisoners%20in%20Azerbaijan%20-%20August%202014.pdf as of 10/29/14
- list.html: An html document converted from the PDF using a pdf2html tool. This file has not been edited at all--all mistakes are corrected by the parser itself.


    Descriptions of output files

- articles.csv: List of the articles that prisoners have been charged with, along with their corresponding criminal codes.
- placesOfDetention.csv: List of the prisons where prisoners are being kept.
- prisoners.csv: This is the primary spreadsheet, containing the data that belongs to each prisoner.
- subtypes.csv: A list of prisoner subtypes (ex. Theologians section under Religious Activists) and their descriptions.


    Not retrieved from PDF

- Footnotes: Unable to retrieve the footnotes at the bottom of many of the pages.
- Charge Descriptions: Since the descriptions of articles in the PDF are inconsistent (identical article numbers often have different descriptions), decided not to retrieve them with the parser.


Note about portraits: It was impossible to programatically determine which portrait belonged to which prisoner, because the portraits were not organized well in relation to the other data in the PDF. Therefore, the portraits have been manually labeled with their corresponding prisoner and placed in lib/aug2014PdfParser/portraits.
