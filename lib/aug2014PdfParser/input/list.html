Many Azerbaijani human rights defenders took a personal risk to work <br/>on  this  list.  Some  were  arrested  even  before  this  English  translation <br/>saw the light of day.  <br/>
 <br/>
Institutions  tasked  with  defending  human  rights  in  Europe  –  and  in <br/>particular  the  Council  of  Europe  of  which  Azerbaijan  is  a  member  – <br/>owe  it  to  these  brave  defenders  of  humen  rights  to  take  this  list <br/>seriously … and to act.  <br/>

<b>PREFACE – STANDING UP FOR EUROPEAN VALUES </b> <br/><b> <br/></b><i>This  is  a  list  of  shame  for  the  authorities  in  Azerbaijan.  The  existence  of  this  list  is  also  a <br/>testimony  to  the  courage  and  strength  of  the  community  of  human  rights  defenders  in <br/>Azerbaijan  today.  It  exposes  the  discrepancy  between  human  rights  obligations  and  the <br/>systematic violation of these committments occuring in Azerbaijan today. <br/> <br/>Azerbaijan  is  a  member  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  and  therefore  bound  by  the  European <br/>Convention  on  Human  Rights.  In  May  2014,  Azerbaijan  assumed  the  chairmanship  of  the <br/>organization.  However,  despite  this,  the  Azerbaijani  authorities  have  recently  unleashed  an <br/>unprecedented  wave  of  repression,  targeting  opposition  politicians,  journalists,  civil  society <br/>representatives, and human rights defenders.  <br/> <br/>Today, human rights activists such as Leyla Yunus, Rasul Jafarov, and Intiqam Aliyev – who <br/>worked on this list and are now themselves political prisoners -  stand for the many who are <br/>defending  basic  human  rights  and  European  values  in  Azerbaijan  and  who  are  subject  to <br/>repression and imprisonment for doing so. And yet fear of repression did not stop them – and <br/>many  others  –  from  producing  this  comprehensive  list  of  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan, <br/>which included 98 names.  <br/> <br/>The targeting of those who document human rights violations in Azerbaijan is reminiscent of <br/>the  fate  of  previous  generations  of  dissidents  and  human  rights  defenders  in  autocratic <br/>regimes. It conjurs memories of the signatories of Charter 77, the Committee for the Defense <br/>of  the Unjustly Prosecuted or  the Polish  Workers Defence Committee in  communist Central <br/>Europe. Back in the 1970s the playright and activist Vaclav Havel wrote:  <br/> </i><br/>
<i>“We  never  decided  that  we  would  go  to  jail.  In  fact,  we  never  decided  to  become <br/>dissidents... we simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought to do, <br/>and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less.”  </i><br/>
<i> <br/>The human rights defenders behind this list represent today’s generation of European human <br/>rights  defenders.  They  are  continuing  a  noble  tradition  of  doing  “what  is  decent,”  and <br/>speaking out for the rights of others. By “living in truth,” they defend the common values on <br/>which  a  Europe  respectful  of  rights  must  be  built.  And  for  this  they  are  now  paying  a  very <br/>high  personal  price.  It  is  in  the  common  interest  of  Democrats  across  Europe  to  preserve <br/>respect for human rights by drawing urgent attention to the abuses documented here.  <br/> <br/></i><b> </b><br/>

<b>INTRODUCTION <br/></b> <br/>To  draw  attention  to  the  growing  number  of  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan  and  the <br/>unprecedented wave of repression seen of late, civil society organizations operating within the <br/>country  present  this  report.  The  number  of  politically  motivated  arrests,  detentions,  and <br/>imprisonments  has  increased  sharply  after  the  26  January  2013  defeat  of  a  Parliamentary <br/>Assembly  of  the  Council  of  Europe  (PACE)  resolution  on  “The  follow-up  to  the  issue  of <br/>political prisoners in Azerbaijan.”1 Astonishingly, the situation has become even worse since <br/>Azerbaijan assumed presidency at the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 14 May <br/>2014. <br/> <br/>This  report  contains  a  list  of  cases  of  those  currently  detained  or  imprisoned  on  politically <br/>motivated charges, as of 3 June 2014. The list has been drawn up according to the criteria set <br/>out in PACE Resolution No. 1900, from 3 October 2012.2 <br/> <br/>To  compile  this  report,  a  series  of  consultations  were  conducted  with  local  human  rights <br/>defenders  who:  1)  studied  relevant  reports  of  local  and  international  human  rights <br/>organizations;  2)  examined  documents  from  influential  international  organizations  that <br/>Azerbaijan is member of, and has commitments to – in particular, the Council of Europe; 3) <br/>monitored  the  press;  4)  monitored  court  cases;  5)  examined  court  verdicts  and  other  legal <br/>documents; 5) and interviewed the families, lawyers, and defense committees of the political <br/>prisoners included in this report. <br/> <br/>The  report  provides  detailed  information  about  each  of  the  political  prisoners,  including  the <br/>facts  and  circumstances  of  their  arrests,  political  motivations,  and  photos.  (Photos  were  not <br/>available for every prisoner.) <br/> <br/>Cases included in the report are divided into seven categories:  <br/> <br/>
A.  Journalists and bloggers <br/>B.  Human rights defenders <br/>C.  Youth activists <br/>D.  Politicians <br/>E.  Religious activists <br/>F.  Lifetime prisoners <br/>G.  Other cases <br/> <br/>The last three categories are divided into subcategories, which are detailed in the report.  <br/>

<i><b> <br/> <br/></b></i><b>1. Abdul Abdulmanaf oglu Abilov  <br/></b> <br/><b>Date of arrest: </b>22 November 2013   <br/> <br/><b>Charge:  </b>Criminal  Code  Article  234.4.3  (Illegal  purchase  or <br/>storage  with  intent  to  sell,  manufacture,  process,  transport,  or <br/>transfer a large amount of narcotics or psychotropic substances) <br/><i> <br/></i><b>Place  of  detention:  </b>Baku Investigative Prison No. 1 (Kurdakhani <br/>pre-trial detention center) <br/> <br/><b>Case  background:  </b>Abilov  was  the  administrator  of  a  popular <br/>Facebook  page,  “Yaltaqlara  Dur  Deyək”  (“Let’s  say  no  to  suck-<br/>ups”),  as  well  as  other  critical  pages  on  social  media  networks. <br/>Abilov created another Facebook page on election fraud after the 9 October 2013 presidential <br/>election  and  managed  it  until  his  arrest.  On  this  page,  he  widely  disseminated  photos  and <br/>videos showing election fraud. The social network activist was arrested on 22 November 2013 <br/>by  employees  of  the  Main  Department  to  Combat  Organized  Crime  and  was  taken  to  the <br/>mentioned Department. He was sentenced to three months of pre-trial detention the following <br/>day, 23 November, by the Narimanov District Court. Although he should have been taken to <br/>investigative prison after the sentence that was issued, Abilov was instead taken back to the <br/>police  station,  where  he  was  unlawfully  held  until  27  November.  On  29  November,  Baku <br/>Court of Appeals Judge Hasan Ahmadov upheld the pre-trial detention sentence. <br/> <br/>Police claimed to have found four grams of heroin in the pocket of Abilov’s waistcoat at his <br/>house (similar charges have been used against numerous activists during the last few years). <br/>The police officers who first searched Abilov’s home initially confiscated a notebook of his. <br/>A few hours later, Abilov’s Facebook page, “Yaltaqlara Dur Deyək,” was shut down. On the <br/>day of Abilov’s arrest, his brother-in-law, Ramil Ahadov, was also taken to the police station. <br/>At the police station, Ahadov was asked whether he had a Facebook profile, and was later set <br/>free without further questioning.  <br/> <br/>At  the  29  November  trial,  Abilov  stated  that  he  had  been  blatantly  told  he  was  arrested <br/>because of his Facebook posts. He said that he had been handcuffed in the street and taken to <br/>his  home  for  the  police  search.  According  to  Abilov,  the  police  saw  that  there  were  many <br/>people  at  his  home,  and  therefore  they  claimed  that  the  drugs  were  found  in  a  waistcoat <br/>hanging  in  one  of  the  rooms.  Abilov  added  that  he  had  been  subjected  to  psychological <br/>pressure and beaten at the police station, and was forced to sign a confession against his will. <br/>His relatives, as well as his lawyer Elchin Sadigov, also believe that the case was politically <br/>motivated and that Abilov has been imprisoned without reliable evidence.  <br/> <br/>Abilov  was  <i><b>sentenced  to  five  and  half  years  by  the  decision  of  the  Baku  Grave  Crimes <br/>Court dated May 27, 2014</b></i>.  <br/> <br/>

 <br/><b>Charge:  </b>Criminal  Code  Article  221.3  (Hooliganism  committed  with  a <br/>weapon or objects used as a weapon) <br/> <br/><b>Place of detention: </b>Penitentiary Institution № 14  <br/> <br/><b>Case  background:  </b>Alibayli,  editor-in-chief  of  <i>Nota  Bene</i>,  a  newspaper  that  has  often <br/>published  critical  articles,  was  accused  of  arguing  with  and  hitting  someone  named  Namig <br/>Amirov – a person he did not know – with a stone in the yard of school No. 260, located in <br/>the  Khatai  district  of  Baku  on  29  July  2013.  On  31  July,  the  journalist  was  arrested  in  a <br/>teahouse  and  taken  to  police  station  №37,  where  he  was  sentenced  to  two  days  of <br/>administrative  detention.  Alibayli  was  charged  with  hooliganism,  a  charge  that  has  been <br/>widely  used  in  political  cases  against  journalists  and  activists  in  recent  years.  On  2  August, <br/>Khatai District Court Judge Habil Mammadov sentenced Alibayli to two months in pre-trial <br/>detention. <i><b>On 13 November, the Khatai District Court found Alibayli guilty and sentenced <br/>him  to  four  years  in  jail</b></i>.  On  29  May  2014,  the  Baku  Appeals  Court  upheld  this  decision <br/>without making any changes to it. <br/><b> <br/></b>Alibayli’s newspaper published many articles harshly  criticizing the authorities. Prior to his <br/>arrest,  <i>Nota  Bene</i>  published  an  article  about  a  business  matter  related  to  President  Ilham <br/>Aliyev’s  family,  as  well  as  a  critical  open  letter  from  former  Minister  of  Defense  Rahim <br/>Gaziyev to President Aliyev. Upon publication of this open letter, Gaziyev was also detained <br/>and warned at the police office with regard to the letter. <br/> <br/>Alibayli  was  arrested  on  the  basis  of  a  complaint  filed  by  a  citizen  named  Namig  Amirov. <br/>However,  the  journalist  stated  that  he  had  never  met  Amirov.  The  investigation  failed  to <br/>provide any other evidence, apart from the testimony of the complainant, on how the meeting <br/>took  place.  There  were  serious  contradictions  between  the  preliminary  testimony  of  the <br/>complainant during the investigation, and the testimonies he later gave during trial.  <br/> <br/>Alibayli  had  previously  been  sentenced  to  imprisonment  under  defamation  charges  several <br/>times  between  2009  and  2010.  Appeals  regarding  two  of  these  defamation  cases  are  under <br/>consideration by the European Court of Human Rights. Alibayli is recognized as prisoner of <br/>conscience  by  Amnesty  international.3 He  has  a  mentally  disabled  child  who  is  a  Group  1 <br/>invalid.  His  wife  is  unemployed.  The  US-based  Committee  to  Protect  Journalists  has <br/>expressed its concern over his arrest.4  <br/>

<b>Date of arrest: </b>21 May 2012 <br/> <br/><b>Charge:  </b>Criminal  Code  Articles  167.2.2.1  (Importing,  distributing  or <br/>selling  religious  literature,  goods  or  any  other  religious  informational <br/>content  as  a  person  or  as  part  of  a  group  without  special  dispensation <br/>with intent to sell or distribute); 234.1 (Illegal purchase or storage with <br/>intent  to  sell,  manufacture,  process,  transport,  or  transfer  narcotics  or <br/>psychotropic substances); 281.2 (Public appeals  for the violent  capture <br/>of  authority,  violent  deduction  of  authority  or  violent  change  of <br/>constitutional  grounds  or infringement of the territorial  integrity of the <br/>Azerbaijan  Republic,  as  well  as  distribution  of  materials  of  such <br/>content);  and  283.2.3  (Actions  directed  to  incite  national,  racial,  or <br/>religious  hostility,  humiliation  of  national  advantage,  as  well  as  actions  directed  to  restrict <br/>citizens’ rights, or establishment of the superiority of citizens on the basis of their national or <br/>racial  belonging,  creeds  committed  publicly  or  with  use  of  mass  media  by  an  organized <br/>group) <br/><i> </i> <br/><b>Place of detention: </b>Baku Investigative Prison (Kurdakhani pre-trial detention center) <br/><b> <br/>Case  background:  </b>Aliyev  is  the  editor-in-chief  <a href="http://www.azadxeber.az/">of  www.azadxeber.az,  </a>a  critical  religious-<br/>oriented  website.  Before  Aliyev's  arrest,  the  website  published  materials  criticizing  the <br/>government’s  policy  in  regard  to  religion,  the  allocation  of  too  much  funding  for  the <br/>Eurovision 2012 Song Contest, and the possibility of an LGBT parade in Baku. On the eve of <br/>the  Song  Contest,  after  disseminating  these  materials  and  CDs  containing  the  speeches  of <br/>theologians  Abgul  Suleymanov  and  Tale  Bagirov,  Aliyev  and  nine  other  religious  activists <br/>were arrested. <br/> <br/>The journalist was first charged with possession of drugs. Eight months after his arrest, on 26 <br/>January 2013, three more grave charges were brought against Aliyev. This happened only two <br/>days  after  PACE  voted  against  a  resolution  on  the  situation  of  political  prisoners  in <br/>Azerbaijan. <i><b>On 9 December 2013, Baku Court of Grave Crimes sentenced Aliyev to 10 years <br/>in prison, the full sentence requested by the prosecutor. <br/></b></i> <br/>Nahid  Mammadov,  an  employee  of  the  State  Committee  on  Work  with  Religious <br/>Organizations  who  was  involved  in  the  case  as  an  expert,  identified  instances  of  inciting <br/>national hatred in the speeches contained on the CDs, however, he failed to explain the details <br/>of these instances in the trial. Even if such speeches actually existed, the calls were made by <br/>people not mentioned in this case, and not by Aliyev.  <br/> <br/>Nonetheless,  Aliyev  was  found  guilty  of  the  charges.  A  book  titled  “Möcüzəsiz  möcüzə” <br/>(“Miracle  without  miracle”)  written  by  Arshad  Azimzada,  which  was  taken  from  the <br/>journalist’s house and is claimed to propagate religious extremism, speaks about fasting. The <br/>book has been published in Azerbaijan and is not banned. However, the investigation released <br/>an opinion against the journalist stating that the book had been imported and reflects calls for <br/>religious  extremism.  During  the  presentation  of  the  investigation’s  findings,  and  while  the <br/>expert was answering questions, it became clear that the opinion had been ordered. Although <br/>the  journalist  himself,  and  his  lawyer  Yalchin  Imanov,  stated  in  the  trials  that  Aliyev  was <br/>tortured  by  police  and  sustained  serious  injuries  at  the  time  of  arrest,  these  claims  were  not <br/>

His  house  was  searched,  as  well  as <br/>the office of <i>Bizim Yol</i> newspaper. After the offices were searched, Hashimli’s computer and <br/>other  property  were  confiscated.  The  MNS  said  that  arms  and  ammunition  were  found  in <br/>Hashimli’s  home.  The  official  statement  released  by  the  MNS  stated,  “Hashimli,  in <br/>collaboration with another defendant, Tavakkul Gurbanov, smuggled a huge amount of arms <br/>and  ammunition,  they  had  bought  from  Iranian  citizen  for  sale,  from  Iran  to  Azerbaijan, <br/>overpassing customs control, and illegally carried and stored these arms and ammunition.”6 <br/> <br/>On 18 September 2013,  the Sabail District  Court sentenced Hashimli to  two months  of pre-<br/>trial  detention.  Hashimli  was  publicly  brought  to  the  courthouse  with  a  bag  on  his  head. <br/>During  the  trial,  Hashimli  stated  that  he  suffered  an  injury  to  his  foot  as  a  result  of  harsh <br/>treatment at the time of his arrest. He added that he had also been threatened with torture by <br/>the  MNS.  On  the  day  of  Hashimli’s  arrest,  a  number  of  MNS  officers  searched  his  house. <br/>Although  his  five-year-old  daughter  and  pregnant  wife  were  in  the  house,  the  Even  though <br/>they  had  a  search  warrant,  the  officers  first  attempted  to  use  windows  to  enter  the  house <br/>instead  of  just  knocking  on  the  door.  When  it  turned  out  that  there  were  safety  cameras <br/>operating in the courtyard and inside the apartment, the officers broke the cameras. Although <br/>Hashimli’s wife called on the officers to invite their neighbors, as well as the journalists who <br/>had come to the house during the search, she was ignored. Immediately after the doors opened <br/>upon  conclusion  of  the  search,  Hashimli’s  wife  told  the  journalists  and  human  rights <br/>defenders present that arms and ammunition had been deliberately planted in their apartment. <br/> <br/>Hashimli stated that he has been held in a single cell at the MNS Investigative Prison during <br/>his extended pre-trial detention and during his various appeals hearings. He also said that he <br/>has  been  facing  harassment,  was  oppressed  to  write  an  application  to  refuse  a  principled <br/>position  of  attorney,  and  that  the  light  in  his  cell  is  not  switched  off  at  night.  However,  the <br/>court paid no attention to journalist’s complaints, and officials ignored appeals made by his <br/>relatives. <br/> <br/>

The articles published on this website often criticize the government’s policies on <br/>religion, as  well as social problems of the Masalli region.  In connection with his activity on <br/>this website, Guliyev was repeatedly taken to the police station before his arrest, where was <br/>warned to stop his activity. Local executive authorities also warned Guliyev. Two days before <br/>his  arrest,  on  6  September  2012,  Guliyev  and  another  Masalli  resident,  Rza  Agali,  were <br/>detained and beaten by  police and plain-clothed persons, then taken to  the Masalli  Regional <br/>Police Department. They were released after an instruction from Deputy Police Chief Alifaga <br/>Kazimov at 3:00am.  <br/>
Around 9:00 pm on 8 September, Guliyev and another Masalli resident, Ziya Tahirov, <br/>
protested  against  the  inclusion  of  a  disco  party  in  Nizami  park  as  part  of  a  folklore  festival <br/>being held in Masalli. The two looked for organizers to get additional information about the <br/>event for an article. However, the police dismissed them from the area. Two hours later, when <br/>Guliyev and Tahirov returned to the scene, they saw that the event had ended and that there <br/>was only a police car at the park. The police car approached them, and Deputy Chief Alifaga <br/>Kazimov talked to them for about half an hour, after which they left the area. Afterwards, a <br/>group  of  25  to  30  plain-clothed  persons  arrived  at  the  scene,  where  they  started  to  insult <br/>Guliyev and Tahirov and threw stones at them. Police arrived a little while later and beat and <br/>arrested  the  two  men.  Guliyev  was  charged  with  hooliganism  and  resisting  police.  Eleven <br/>days after the journalist’s arrest, on 20 September, his house was searched. After the search, it <br/>was  claimed  that  a  grenade  had  been  found  in  the  house.  In  December  2012,  Guliyev  was <br/>charged with  publishing  articles  containing  religious enmity, violation of  public order, arms <br/>possession, and insult of the state flag. <i><b>He was convicted and sentenced to eight years in jail <br/>on  5  April  2013  by  the  Lankaran  Court  of  Grave  Crimes.</b></i>  The  Shirvan  Court  of  Appeals <br/>upheld the decision on 9 January 2014. <br/>

The search of the journalist’s house was conducted without a court decision and without the <br/>journalist’s  presence.  There  were  serious  conflicts  in  the  testimonies  of  the  case  witnesses, <br/>who  attended  the  search,  given  in  the  investigation  and  in  trial.  The  court  investigation <br/>revealed that Nahid Shiraliyev, one of the case witnesses, could not read or write (although he <br/>had  signed  the  search  protocol  confirming  that  a  grenade  had  been  found).  In  the  Shirvan <br/>Court of Appeals, Shiraliyev stated that he was taken from his job at the worker’s bazaar by <br/>police  employees  to  act  as  a  case  witness.  He  says  that  each  of  the  two  case  witnesses <br/>received  20  AZN  for  their  efforts.  None  of  the  claimed  victims  faced  Guliyev  during  the <br/>investigation. Most of them were police employees, and they all gave the same testimony in <br/>the trial. In fact, there was no evidence to support the alleged injury to the police employees. <br/>The  state  flag,  which  was  allegedly  torn,  was  not  in  the  materials  of  the  criminal  case  as <br/>evidence. <br/><b> <br/> <br/>6.

For  hours  it  was  impossible  to  get  any  information  about  his <br/>whereabouts, and as a result, the right of Mr. Karimov’s family and his counsel to be given <br/>information  about  his  arrest  was  violated.    On  July  25th,  Narimanov  District  Court,  without <br/>informing Karimov’s lawyer, issued a pre-trial detention order of three months, and although <br/>the order called for Karimov to be transferred to Baku Detention Facility, he was returned to <br/>the Head Organized Crime Fighting Unit, which had executed the capture. His attorney was <br/>able to meet with him only on August 1st in court, and the right for the attorney to meet with <br/>his  client  was  recognized  only  on  August  2nd.    Following  a  four-day  hunger  strike,  Faraj <br/>Karimov was finally transferred to Baku Detention Facility on July 30th. Faraj Karimov stated <br/>that during his detention at the Head Organized Crime Fighting Unit, he was shown physical <br/>pressure and was blackmailed, forced to give testimony under duress.  <br/> <br/>A  few  days  before  Karimov’s  arrest,  his  brother,  Siraj  Karimov,  was  arrested  on  the  same <br/>charges.

Rauf Habibulla oglu Mirkadirov <br/> <br/>Date of arrest: </b>19 April 2014 <br/> <br/><b>Charge:  </b>Criminal  Code  Article<b>  </b>274  (State  betrayal,  that  is  deliberate <br/>action  committed  by  a  citizen  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  to  the <br/>detriment  of  the  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity,  state  security  or <br/>defensibility of the Azerbaijan Republic: changeover to the enemy side, <br/>espionage,  distribution  of  state  secrets  to  a  foreign  state,  rendering <br/>assistance to a foreign state, foreign organization or their representatives <br/>in realization of hostile activity against the Azerbaijan Republic) <br/><b> <br/>Place of detention: </b>Investigative Prison of the Ministry of National Security <br/><b> <br/>Case  background:  </b>Mirgadirov,  who  had  been  the  employee  of  the  Russian-language <br/>newspaper “Zerkalo” for many years, began working as the correspondent of the newspaper <br/>in Turkey in 2010. Mirgadirov was known for his articles in which he analyzed the Armenian-<br/>Azerbaijani  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  Russia's  intervention,  and  the  position  of  the <br/>Azerbaijani  government.  Mirgadirov  was  expelled  from  Turkey  under  the  label  of <br/>“deportation”  and  sent  to  Azerbaijan  on  April  19,  2014.  Several  days  before  issuing <br/>Mirgadirov's  deportation,  Turkish  officials  revoked  his  professional  accreditation  in  Turkey. <br/>He was then arrested by the Ministry of National Security upon arrival in Azerbaijan.  <br/> <br/>Mirgadirov  was  accused  of  spying  for  Armenia  since  2008  and  was  sentenced  to  a  three-<br/>month  pre-trial  imprisonment.  Mirgadirov,  who  is  in  custody  of  MNS,  said  that  he  visited <br/>Armenia  several  times  for  the  national  diplomacy  projects  of  the  Institute  for  Peace  and <br/>Democracy on the solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict: he defended the interests of <br/>Azerbaijan  in  those  events,  has  never  betrayed  his  motherland,  and  called  the  charges  set <br/>against  him  trumped-up.  Chairman  of  the  Institute  for  Peace  and  Democracy,  Leyla  Yunus, <br/>has always been the target of the Azerbaijani government, and was in fact not allowed out of <br/>the country for the purpose of questioning on the case; she and her husband's passports were <br/>taken from them, she was interrogated for hours, and a search was carried out at her home and <br/>office.12                                           <br/>A  search  was  also  conducted  at  the  office  of  <i>Zerkalo,  a</i>  newspaper  where  Mirgadirov  was <br/>working. Documents and the computer of the editor-in-chief, Elchin Shikhli, were seized. As <br/>a  result,  the  newspaper  stopped  publication.  Mirgadirov’s  parents’  house  was  searched  as <br/>well,  though  the  journalist  had  never  lived  there.  The  following  day,  his  father,  Habibulla <br/>Mirgadirov,  passed  away.  The  journalist  was  allowed  to  participate  in  the  funeral  and <br/>mourning ceremonies for three days. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The pre-trial detention of the journalist, and the charges against him, violate a number of legal <br/>provisions. Firstly, the prosecutor who  carried out  the criminal-procedural  leadership on the <br/>case  did  not  participate  in  the  appeal  hearing  for  changing  the  pre-trial  detention  decision <br/>against  the  journalist.  Instead,  a  different  employee  of  the  General  Prosecutor's  Office  took <br/>part  in  the  hearing.  The  prosecutor  who  carries  out  the  criminal-procedural  leadership  for  a <br/>case is required by law to participate in an appeals hearing, in order to justify their decision to <br/>arrest during the procedure.  <br/>Secondly,  in  order  to  issue  pre-trial  detention,  the  court  must  refer  to  the  initial  evidence <br/>presented by the investigative organ. This evidence is considered criminal case material, and <br/>
                                                 <br/>12 Additional information has been replaced about Leyla Yunus’s arrest in the report. <br/>

 <br/>
according  to  legislation  both  the  accused  and  their  defenders  have  the  right  to  access  court <br/>materials.  However,  the  court  has  not  presented  these  materials  to  either  Mirkadirov  or  his <br/>lawyers. Therefore, it was not possible to identify what the basis for this grave crime was, and <br/>what kind of initial evidence was there.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Thirdly,  the  handing  over  of  the  journalist  by  Turkish  authorities  was  not  deportation,  but <br/>extradition.  Because of this,  Mirgadirov put  forth a motion  to hire  a lawyer from Turkey to <br/>take  over  this  issue,  but  the  investigation  banned  the  notary  from  entering  the  prison,  so <br/>power of  attorney  could  not  be  granted.  The  complaints against this  case  were  groundlessly <br/>not fulfilled.  <br/> <br/>The  Reporters  without  Borders,  the  Human  Rights  Watch,  USA  Helsinki  Commission,  the <br/>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the UK, and other organizations have expressed their concern <br/>over the arrest of Rauf Mirgadirov. Mirgadirov has received the “Hasan Bey Zardabi” Award; <br/>the “Freedom of Speech” International Award, founded by Norway's Fritt Ord and Germany's <br/>ZEIT<b>-</b>Stiftung<b> </b>Fund; and has been the Honored Journalist of the Republic of Azerbaijan since <br/>2005.  He  has  worked  at  respected  newspapers  such  as  <i>Democratic  Azerbaijan</i>,  <i>Bu  Gun</i> <br/>(“Today”), and <i>Millet</i> (“Nation”).   <br/>

Sharing  critical  anti-government  posts,  he  also <br/>disseminated  materials  from  the  Jamil  Hasanli  campaign,  the  only  opposition  candidate <br/>running in the election. <br/> <br/>Six  days  before  the  election,  Mursalli  was  arrested  in  Khachmaz  by  the  officers  of  the <br/>Department  Against  Organized  Crime  and  was  brought  to  Baku.  He  was  accused  of  selling <br/>large  quantities  of  drugs,  like  other  social  networking  activists  were.  And  as  with  the  other <br/>accused  activists,  there  was  no  material  evidence  in  the  criminal  case  against  Mursalli  to <br/>prove  these  charges.  To  whom  Mursalli  sold  the  narcotics  could  not  be  identified;  it  was <br/>simply noted that Mursalli saw a pack of presumed narcotics, took it, and put it in his pocket. <br/>During the court hearing, the witnesses of the prosecution – policemen and case witnesses – <br/>stated  that  narcotics  were  found.  However,  no  investigation  was  conducted  on  Mursalli’s <br/>purpose in selling the drugs. <br/> <i><b>Mursalli was sentenced to five years imprisonment through the decision of the Baku Grave <br/>Crimes Court on 2 April 2014.  <br/></b></i> <br/>After  his  arrest,  Mursalli  became  acquainted  with  N!DA  Civic  Movement  activists  at  the <br/>Baku  Investigative  Prison  and  joined  the  organization.

He  too  was  charged  with  drug  possession. <br/>Following  his  arrest,  Ramazanov  was  unlawfully  held  in  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs’ <br/>Main  Department  against  Organized  Crime  for  eleven  days.  After  a  number  of  challenges <br/>from local and international organizations, he was transferred to the investigative prison. <br/> <br/>Well-known  lawyer,  Aslan  Ismayilov,  stated  that  Ramazanov  was  subject  to  torture  and <br/>beatings in custody. Ismayilov’s appeal to relevant agencies demanding an investigation into <br/>this matter yielded no results. On the contrary, Ismayilov was himself detained by police, who <br/>told him to stop making such statements, otherwise he would be punished. A short while later, <br/>Ismayilov was dismissed from the Bar of Lawyers. <i><b>Ramazanov was sentenced to nine years <br/>in  jail  by  a  decision  of  the  Baku  Court  of  Grave  Crimes  on  13  November  2013.  </b></i>On  16 <br/>January  2014  the  Baku  Appeals  Court  and  on  14  May  2014  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  this <br/>verdict.

 <br/><b>12. Tofig Rashid oglu Yagublu <br/> <br/>Date of arrest:</b> 4 February 2013    <br/>                                                            <b> <br/>Charge:</b>  Criminal  Code  Articles  220.1  (Organization  of  mass <br/>disorder accompanied with violence, breaking, arson, destruction <br/>of  property,  application  of  firearms,  explosives,  and  also <br/>rendering of armed resistance to a representative of authority, or <br/>participation  in  such  disorders),  and  315.2  (Use  of  violence <br/>dangerous  to  life  or  health,  concerning a  representative  of <br/>authority in connection with their performance of official duties) <br/> <br/><b>Place of detention: </b>Sheki Penitentiary Institution <br/> <br/><b>Case  background:</b>  Yagublu  is  an  employee  of  <i>Yeni  Musavat  </i>newspaper,  and  Deputy <br/>Chairman  of  the  opposition  Musavat  Party.  He  has  published  critical  articles  in  the  <i>Yeni <br/>Musavat  </i>and  on  social  networking  sites  regularly,  and  is  an  active  participant  in  political <br/>opposition activities. <br/> <br/>On 23 January 2013, mass protests broke out in the Ismayilli region, where locals demanded <br/>the resignation of the head of the local executive authority, leading to confrontations. A day <br/>following  the  protest,  on  24  January,  Yagublu  visited  Ismayilli  as  a  journalist,  but  he  was <br/>detained by police in the city center and forcefully brought back to Baku. <br/> <br/>Yagublu  was  arrested  following  his  visit  to  Ismayilli.  On  26  January,  most  of  Azerbaijan’s <br/>television  stations  violated  his  right  to  presumption  of  innocence  by  reporting  that  the <br/>Ismayilli  incidents  were  triggered  by  Yagublu  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Republican <br/>Alternative  (REAL)  Movement,  Ilgar  Mammadov.  The  media  only  quoted  the  official <br/>statement  released  by  the  Prosecutor  General’s  Office  and  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs. <br/>The broadcasts described Yagublu as a criminal. <br/> <br/>On 29 January, Yagublu was summoned to the Grave Crimes Investigation Department of the <br/>Prosecutor General’s Office. He was released after being questioned about his Ismayilli visit. <br/>When he was summoned to the Investigation Department again on 4 February, Yagublu was <br/>sentenced to two months of pre-trial detention.  <br/> <br/>Yagublu’s visit to Ismayilli was conducted under his journalistic credentials, issued by <i>Yeni <br/>Musavat  </i>newspaper.  After  observing  events  in  the  city  center  with  other  journalists,  he  was <br/>held  by  police  and  taken  to  the  Ismayilli  Rgional  Police  Office,  where  he  had  a  brief <br/>conversation with Deputy Police Chief Shohrat Karimov. Upon his release, Yagublu left the <br/>region accompanied by police officers. The pictures taken by journalists that day clearly show <br/>Yagublu standing in the city center when police detained him, with no violent protests taking <br/>place. 1  During  the  trial,  the  investigation  failed  to  prove  that  Yagublu  met  with  Ilgar <br/>Mammadov – who also faced the same charge –  to plan a crime before or during the Ismayilli <br/>visit. <br/> <br/>Ismayilli residents who were accused in connection to the protests, stated in the trial that they <br/>did not know Yagublu. The alleged victims in the criminal case stated in their testimony that <br/>they had neither material nor moral claims against the defendants. <i><b>Yagublu was sentenced to </b></i><br/>

Shortly,  before  his <br/>arrest, Zeynalli published an article titled “Ilham Aliyev Against Independence,” in which he <br/>criticized the President and stated that the Azerbaijani people were owed an apology17.   <br/> <br/>Zeynalli has repeatedly been sued by officials and has faced pressure for his critical articles. <br/>One  month  before  his  arrest,  the  Press  Council,  which  relies  heavily  on  the  support  of <br/>government  authorities,  declared  <i>Khural</i>  newspaper  as  a  racketeering  newspaper.  A  number <br/>of  lawsuits  were  filed  against  the  newspaper,  resulting  in  the  imposition  of  huge  fines.  The <br/>newspaper  had  no  capacity  to  pay  these  fines.  Prior  to  Zeynalli’s  arrest,  head  of  the <br/>Presidential Administration, Ramiz Mehdiyev, sued <i>Khural</i> newspaper. The court fulfilled the <br/>lawsuit,  ruling  for  a  10,000  AZN  fine  against  the  paper.  Although  <i>Khural</i>  published  a <br/>retraction, Mehdiyev continued to demand payment of the fine. Because the newspaper failed <br/>to  pay these fines, Ministry of Justice bailiffs visited the newspaper’s office on 20 October <br/>2011  (eight  days  before  Zeynalli’s  arrest),  and  confiscated  property.  As  a  result,  the <br/>newspaper went out of publication. <br/> <br/>Shortly  thereafter,  Zeynalli  was  arrested  by  the  Anti-Corruption  Department  of  Prosecutor <br/>General’s Office, based on an appeal filed by Member of Parliament (MP) Gular Ahmadova, <br/>(who has since been dismissed from parliament). Ahmadova claimed that Zeynalli requested a <br/>bribe  from  her.  New  charges  were  later  brought  against  Zeynalli  under  separate  articles. <br/><i><b>Under a decision passed by Baku Court of Grave Crimes on 12 March 2013, Zeynalli was <br/>sentenced to nine years  in jail.</b></i> The Baku Court of Appeals upheld the decision on 13 May <br/>2013, and the Supreme Court did the same on 11 September 2013. <br/>

 <br/>Former  MP  Ahmadova,  who  caused  the  arrest  of  the  journalist,  was  herself  arrested  in <br/>February 2013. The former rector of Azerbaijan International University, Elshad Abdullayev <br/>(who  now  lives  in  France  as  an  emigrant),  disseminated  a  secretly  recorded  video  featuring <br/>Ahmadova discussing a price of 1 million USD to make Abdullayev a parliamentarian. Based <br/>on  this  video18,  Ahmadova  was charged  with  embezzlement  and sentenced  to three  years  in <br/>jail. After her arrest, Ahmadova told the media19 that she had not put Zeynalli into prison by <br/>herself, but confessed to carrying out an order.  <br/> <br/>The  witnesses  speaking  in  Zeynalli’s  trial  gave  testimonies  contradictory  to  the <br/>investigation’s  findings.  In  addition,  the  recording  of  the  conversation  between  Ahmadova <br/>and Zeynalli played in the trial as evidence of extortion, revealed that the Editor-in-Chief did <br/>not make any threats, nor did he request any bribe.  The fact that the secretly recorded audio <br/>file  was  presented  by  the  investigation  as  evidence  indicates  that  the  charge  is  unfounded  – <br/>according to the Constitution, secretly recorded audio materials are inadmissible in court. <br/><b> <br/></b>On  14  August  2012,  an  appeal  was  submitted  to  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  in <br/>regard to Zeynalli’s illegal arrest, the extension of his pre-trial detention, phone-tapping, and <br/>search of his house and apartment. Another appeal was sent to the European Court of Human <br/>Rights against the judgments passed by the Azerbaijani courts on the lawsuit against  <i>Khural</i> <br/>newspaper  filed  by  Vugar  Safarov,  the  Head  of  the  State  Support  Fund  for  Mass  Media <br/>Development. <br/> <br/>A  report  of  the  Council  of  Europe  Human  Rights  Commissioner  described  the  charges <br/>brought against Zeynalli as spurious.20 <br/> <br/>

<b>a.  Case of the Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies </b><br/>
<b>Centre </b><br/>
<b> <br/></b>EMDS,  together  with  the  Volunteers’  International  Cooperation <br/>Public Union (VICPU),  publicized a preliminary opinion21 on 7 October 2013 regarding the <br/>conduct of the 9 October 2013 presidential election. The opinion held that Azerbaijan lacked <br/>a  pre-election  environment  that  enabled  free  and  fair  elections,  and  noted  that  the  voting <br/>process  was  accompanied  by  serious  legal  violations.  The  OSCE  Office  for  Democratic <br/>Institutions and Human Rights used the EMDS report, in addition to information from its own <br/>observers, in compiling its own critical report about the election. <br/> <br/>After  EMDS  publicized  its  report,  on  31  October  2013,  the  Grave  Crimes  Investigation <br/>Department  of  the  Prosecutor  General’s  Office  conducted  a  search  of  EMDS’s  office, <br/>confiscating  financial  and  legal  documents  and  two  computers  belonging  to  EMDS  and  its <br/>partner  organizations.  The  Prosecutor  General’s  Office  released  a  statement  saying  that  an <br/>investigation had been launched into legal violations by EMDS. Head of EMDS, Anar Asaf <br/>oglu  Mammadli,  as  well  as  EMDS  Executive  Director  Bashir  Suleymanli  and  the  head  of <br/>VICPU Elnur Mammadli, were prohibited from leaving the country. <br/> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
EMDS  had  also  organized  nationwide  election  monitoring  prior  to  the  2013  presidential <br/>elections,  and  regularly  informed  local  and  international  communities  regarding  the <br/>shortcomings and fraud that were taking place in Azerbaijan’s electoral process.  Because <br/>
of <br/>
their continuous monitoring of the government, regular smear campaigns against EMDS and <br/>its  leading  personnel  were  launched  by  government  media.  Notably,  EMDS  was  one  of  the <br/>initiators and active participants of the Sing for Democracy campaign held on the eve of the <br/>Eurovision Song Contest in Baku in May 2012. <br/><i><b> <br/></b></i> <br/>

 <br/>
In  late  October  2013,  Mammadli  was  regularly  summoned  to  the  Investigation  Department, <br/>and visited often to testify.

The  organization’s  main <br/>purpose is to spread the idea of Azerbaijan’s open society in the West and to contribute to the <br/>building of a civil society in Azerbaijan. Huseynli is well-respected in Azerbaijan and abroad <br/>for his principaled views, human rights activisties and as an educator. <br/> <br/>On  March  31,  2014,  Huseynli  was  detained  by  police  pursuant  to  a  complaint  of  Ganja <br/>resident Arzu Gahramanov, who claimed to have been knifed and injured by Huseynli during <br/>an altercation.  Based on a charge of “hooliganism,” a criminal case was opened. After two <br/>days in  detention,  Huseynli was  released on April  2nd  under police watch. The investigation <br/>refused to turn over any documents relating to the investigation to to Huseynli’s. His attorney <br/>was  given  only  the  order  of  arrest,  on  which  the  detention  was  not  substantiated,  and  no <br/>information was given regarding where to file a complaint against this decision. Nonetheless, <br/>the investigation continued and the case went to court. <br/> <br/>During  the  court  proceedings,  Arzu  Gahramanov,  claiming  to  be  knifed  by  Huseynli,  could <br/>not explain why the defendant would do such a thing; Gahramanov could only state “maybe <br/>he has been ordered from abroad, that is why.” In addition to this, it was never determined, <br/>during  the  investigation  nor  during  the  court  proceedings,  to  whom  the  fingerprints  on  the <br/>allegedly  used  knife  belonged.    Nonetheless,  on  July  14th,  2014,  Nizami  District  Court  of <br/>Ganja  City  <i><b>issued  a  verdict  sentencing  Huseynli  to  6  years  of  imprisonment</b></i>,  and  he  was <br/>taken into custody in the courtroom.  <br/> <br/>After  the  verdict  was  issued,  the  Embassy  of  the  United  States,  the  spokesperson  for  the <br/>European  Union's  Commissioner  for  External  Relations,  the  United  Kingdom's  Minister  of <br/>European issues, and the European Union Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum all either <br/>expressed their concern about Huseynli’s arrest, or condemned the verdict. <br/> <br/><b> <br/> <br/> </b><br/>

 <br/><b>19. Aliabbas Fakhraddin oğlu Rustamov <br/></b> <br/><b>Date of Detention</b>: June 28, 2014  <br/> <br/><b>The Charge:</b> Provision 312.2 of the Criminal Code (The presentation of a bribe to official for <br/>commitment of obviously illegal actions (inaction) by him or repeated presentation of a bribe)  <br/> <br/><b>Place of Detention</b>: Baku Detention Facility (Kurdakhani Prison)  <br/> <br/><b>Brief Summary of the Case:  </b>Aliabbas Rustamov is the head of the Yasavul Law Firm and a <br/>prominent lawyer.  Prior to his arrest, Rustamov acted as one of government’s harshest critics.  <br/>On  his  Facebook  profile  page,  he  continuously  expressed  harsh  criticism  of  the  country's <br/>problems and shared condemning articles. During the 2013 presidential  elections, Rustamov <br/>supported the opposition nominee Jamil Hasanli of the National Council, and took part at his <br/>rallies.  Even after the  election, he attended the events,  public hearings,  and marathons held <br/>by National Council. <br/> <br/>Prior  to  his  arrest,  Rustamov  petitioned  to  become  a  counsel  at  the  court  proceeding  on  tax <br/>evasion  charges  of  prisoner  of  conscience,  Anar  Mammadov  (head  of  EMDS).    Though <br/>Rustamov  is  a  prominent  attorney  within  this  legal  sphere,  difficulties  created  in  the <br/>administrative  process  prevented  him  from  participating  in  Anar  Mammadov’s  defense. <br/>Mammadov  had  to  sign  his  agreement  to  be  represented  by  Aliabbas  Rustamov  in  the <br/>presence  of  a  notary  public,  but  the  prison  where  he  is  detained  did  not  afford  him  such <br/>ability.      <br/> <br/>On  March  17th,  2014,  Rustamov  drew  the  attention  of  the  public  by  making  a  very  harsh <br/>statement against President Ilham Aliyev’s address to the nation.  The plea was first published <br/>as  an  open  letter  in  newspaper  <i>Azadliq</i>,  and  later  disseminated  via  other  media  outlets  and <br/>social media, creating a major buzz.25  <br/> <br/>Rustamov began his statement against the president “being fully informed about the activities <br/>of  the  high-ranking  officials  surrounding  you  to  actually  amount  to  robbery”  he  lists  facts <br/>concerning  the  theft  of  budget  funds  in  the  amount  of  100  million  AZD.  After  the  letter,  it <br/>was expected that Rustamov would be arrested – on June 28th 2014 he was. On the day of his <br/>arrest Rustamov was only able to talk to a reporter from the newspaper, <i>Azadliq.</i>    <br/> <br/>
&#34;On the day of his arrest, Aliabbas Rustamov called me and told me that he is being accused <br/>of taking bribes.  He considers his arrest to be ordered and in connection with his letter to the <br/>president” - Vidadi Mammadov, Reporter for <i>Azadliq</i>. 26 <br/>
 <br/>The  local  press  has  called  the  formal  charges  filed  against  Aliabbas  Rustamov  “absurd.” <br/>Rustamov’s arrest  had nothing to  do with  bribery, rather it was because  of his  condemning <br/>position,  advocating  for  people  with  opposing  views,  and  his  harsh  open  letter  addressed  to <br/>the head of the state.  <br/>

She, has  worked on numerous  projects relating to  human <br/>rights,  political  persecution,  corruption,  human  trafficking,  gender  issues,  violations  of <br/>property rights, monitoring of court proceedings, peace initiatives, and more. She is the author <br/>of  a  multitude  of  reports  on  political  prisoners.  For  her  human  rights-related  work,  Yunus <br/>received  the  National  Order  of  the  French  Legion  of  Honor  by  the  Republic  of  France  in <br/>2013.    Yunus  openly  criticizes  the  Azerbaijani  political  leadership  in  both  national  and <br/>foreign  press.    Since  2005,  she  has  been  involved  in  Track  II  Public  Diplomacy  efforts <br/>(“people-to-people  diplomacy”),  and  has  launched  a  unique  joint  dialogue  project  together <br/>with Armenia’s Region Research Center. <br/> <br/>On April 28, 2014  at  22:30,  Leyla  Yunus and  her husband, Arif Yunusov, were detained at <br/>the Baku Bina airport while boarding an international flight to Doha, Qatar, where they were <br/>to  attend  an  international  event.  Their  passports,  computers,  and  other  documents  were <br/>confiscated, without an official order prohibiting them from leaving the country, or a warrant <br/>to  conduct  a  search  of  their  personal  belongings.    That  day,  Leyla  Yunus  was  subjected  to <br/>inhumane treatment, threatened with rape, and despite suffering from diabetes, was forbidden <br/>from  eating  and  using  the  bathroom  for  an  extended  period  of  time.    During  the  following <br/>days,  searches  were  conducted  at  the  Yunus’  apartment  and  the  Institute  for  Peace  and <br/>Democracy  offices,  all  computers  and  electronic  media  were  seized.  The  Court  of  Appeals <br/>rejected all complaints filed against the searches in all three locations, as well as complaints <br/>filed concerning the illegal detention at the airport. <br/> <br/>On  April  29  and  May  30,  2014,  the  Chief  Prosecutor’s  Office  issued  statements  that  Leyla <br/>and  Arif  Yunus  were  to  be  questioned  as  witnesses  in  the  case  against  journalist,  Rauf <br/>Mirkadirov,  pursuant  to  provision  274  of  the  Criminal  Code  (treason).  In  an  objection  to <br/>having  her  passport  “held  hostage”  by  the  Investigative  Unit,  Leyla  declined  to  go  for <br/>interrogation; she would only cooperate with the investigation once her passport was returned.  <br/>The  Nasimi  District  Court  refused  to  consider  the  complaint  that  Leyla’s  passport  taken <br/>hostage. The Court of Appeals  then dismissed the appeal  filed based on the Nasimi  District <br/>Court's decision.  <br/> <br/>During this time, the bank accounts of Leyla and Arif Yunus were frozen without any official <br/>court order, only a letter from  the Prosecutor’s  Office.  The subsequent complaint that was <br/>filed has not been considered by the Nasimi District Court, and the appeal has been dismissed.   <br/>

 <br/>On  30  July  2014,  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  Grave  Crimes  Investigative  Unit  of  the  Chief  <br/>Prosecutor‘s Office charged Leyla Yunus with Articles 274, 178.3.2, 192.2.2, 213.2.2, 320.1, <br/>and 320.2 provisions of Azerbaijan Republic's Criminal Code. <br/> <br/>On the same day, Leyla Yunusova was sentenced to three months pre-trial detention based on <br/>the Nasimi District Court’s ruling and a motion filed by the Investigative Unit. <br/> <br/>Despite not being officially indicted until 30 July 2014, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office and its <br/>officials  have  presented  Leyla  and  Arif  Yunus  as  criminals  in  official  statements,  violating <br/>their right to presumption of innocence. <br/> <br/>All  of  the  complaints  filed  by  Leyla  Yunus  were  subject  to  politically-motivated <br/>discrimination,  her  applications  have  not  even  been  considered.    Leyla  was  declared  a <br/>prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International immediately after her arrest.   <br/> <br/>Leyla  Yunus’s  arrest  was  politically  motivated  and  directly  related  to  her  work  to  bring <br/>awareness  to  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan.  She  has  studied  the  cases  of  more  than  100 <br/>political prisoners and revealed their illegal arrest to be entirey politically motivated. Weeks <br/>before  her  arrest,  Leyla  Yunus  and  another  human  rights  defender,  Rasul  Jafarov,  together <br/>with  several  organizations,  worked  on  a  unified  list  of  political  prisoners.    The  list  you  are <br/>currently reading was jointly prepared by them. Unfortunately, a few days prior to presenting <br/>the public with this list, Leyla Yunus and Rasul Jafarov were both detained. Their names were <br/>added by other members of the working group after their arrests. <br/> <br/> <br/><b>21.

Facility <br/>
(Kurdakhani prison)  <br/> <br/><b>Case  Background:  </b>Arif  Yunusov  Seyfulla  oğlu  (Arif <br/>Yunus)  is  59  years  old.    As  a  historian,    he  worked  at  the <br/>History  Institute  at  the  Azerbaijani  National  Academy  of <br/>Sciences from 1972 to 1992. In 1992, Yunus became head <br/>of  the  Information  Analysis  Department  at  the  Presidential  Apparatus  of  Azerbaijan.    From <br/>1993 to 1994, he was the president of the “Azeri” Information Analysis Center. Since 1995, <br/>he  has  headed  the  department  on  conflict  and  migration  at  the  Institute  of  Peace  and <br/>Democracy  (IPD).    He  is  an  expert  at  the  Network  for  Early  Prevention  of  Conflicts  and <br/>Conflict Monitoring, as well as the CIS and Baltic States Migration Research Center.  Yunus <br/>has  authored  more  than  200  academic  research  papers  in  Azerbaijan  and  abroad,  ranging  in <br/>topic  from  the  history  of  Azerbaijan,  to  the  Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict,  religious  issues, <br/>ethnic minorities, and refugees.  <br/> <br/>On 30 July 2014, a criminal case was launched against Arif Yunus based on two provisions of <br/>Azerbaijan’s Criminal Code: 274 (treason against the State) and 178.3.2 (fraud, with a large <br/>

 <br/>
amount of damage). Both his case, and the case against Leyla Yunus are integral parts of the <br/>investigation into Rauf Mirkadirov, pursuant to the &#34;treason against the State&#34; provision. The <br/>Leyla and Arif Yunus are accused of sending Mirkadirov to international conferences which <br/>included  Armenians,  and  having  him  collaborate  on  an  espionage  plot  with  the  intelligence <br/>agencies of Armenia. <br/> <br/>While his wife was arrested arrested on 30 July, and Arif Yunus, remained under police watch <br/>due to health conditions. However, on 5 August, Investigator Ibrahim Lambaranski, asked for <br/>a pretrial detention order for Arif based on his “meetings with criminally prosecuted subjects <br/>in  a  criminal  case  or  subjects  of  interest  that  may  be  prosecuted,  internet  correspondence, <br/>interviews with media and news sites giving one-sided, false, information.” The same day, the <br/>Nasimi District Court Judge, Elman Isayev, issued a three month pretiral detention order for <br/>Arif Yunus.   <br/> <br/>The Yunus’ cases have been accompanied by numerous violations. Their passsports and other <br/>documents  were  confiscated  with  no  court  order,  and  they  were  banned  from  living  the <br/>country without any legal basis. <br/> <br/>The  Institute  for  Peace  and  Democracy,  where  there  both  work,  was  preparing  a  list  of <br/>political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan,  and  is  dedicated  to  advancing  human  rights  and  outing <br/>government  repression.    Though  the  orginization  operates  strictly  as  an  NGO,  the <br/>investigators consider it to be an illegal business and have accused the two of tax evasion. <br/> <br/>Arif Yunusov is a distinguished political  analyst  known for his criticism of the government, <br/>but his arrest is also believed to be a tool to put pressure on his wife Leyla, who is seen as a <br/>much larger threat by the regime.  <br/> <br/>As  mentioned  above,  Leyla  and  Arif  Yunus,  and  human  rights  activist,  Rasul  Jafarov,  were <br/>working on a comprehensive list of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. It is believed that they <br/>were  arrested  in  order  to  prevent  an  international  discussion  on  the  problem  of  political <br/>prisoners under the Aliyev regime.  <br/> <br/> <br/>

Rasul Agahasan oğlu Jafarov <br/></b>  <br/><b>Date of Detention:</b> 2 August 2 2014   <br/> <br/><b>The  Charges:</b>  Article  192.2.2  of  the  Criminal  Code <br/>(conducting  a  largely  profitable  illegal  business),  213.1 <br/>(evasion  of  taxes  or  social  insurance  contributions,  in <br/>significant  amounts),  308.2  (abuse  of  authority  which <br/>resulted in a hefty outcome or when made with the intend to <br/>influence an election (referendum) <br/> <br/><b>Place  of  Detention</b>:  Baku  Detention  Facility  (Kurdakhani <br/>Prison) <br/> <br/><b>Brief Summary of the Case:   </b>Born on 17 August 1984, Jafarov received his bachelor's and <br/>master's degrees in law.  Since 2007, he has worked as a lawyer at the Institute for Reporters' <br/>Freedom  and  Safety.    In  August  2009,  Jafarov  became  the  Chairman  of  the  Association  of <br/>Television  and  Alternative  Media  Development  Center.  In  2010,  he  co-founded  the  Human <br/>Rights Club, which focuses on the defense of human rights in Azerbaijan. He is also an active <br/>member of the Board of Directors of the Republic Alternative (REAL) Movement, and head <br/>of the Legal Defense and Education Society. <br/> <br/>As  a  continuous  defender  of  young  activists  and  political  prisoners,  Rasul  Jafarov  has <br/>coordinated  numerous  campaigns  over  the  last  few  years.  Held  on  the  eve  of  the  2012 <br/>Eurovision song contest, the “Sing for  Democracy”  campaign aimed to  utilize the contest’s <br/>high  profile  to  draw  awareness  to  the  human  rights  conditions  in  Azerbaijan.  Generating <br/>international  interest  in  these  issues  though,  was  met  with  anger  by  the  regime.  Jafarov <br/>continued the campaign under the name “Art of Democracy,”  but any events associated with <br/>the  campaign  were  banned.    Foreign  hotels  in  Baku,  under  pressure  from  authorities,  also <br/>refused  to  host  these  events,  despite  previously  agreeing  to  do  so.  Jafarov  was  also  a <br/>coordinator  of  the  “Expression  Online  Initiative”  campaign,  which  was  launched  in  2012 <br/>during  the  UN  Internet  Governance  Forum  in  Azerbaijan,  with  the  intent  to  attract <br/>international attention to lack of internet freedom in Azerbaijan. <br/> <br/>In  recent  years,  Jafarov  has  been  one  of  the  most  active  human  rights  activists  in  the <br/>international  arena,  with  his  scathing  criticism  and  incisive  reports  on  human  rights  abuses. <br/>He  had  recently  started  to  work  on  issues  relating  to  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan  very <br/>intensely, compiling a full list of political prisoners.  On 24 June 2014, Jafarov presented this <br/>list of political prisoners during the PACE session to the new rapporteur on Human Rights in <br/>Azerbaijan, Pedro Agramunt. This comprehensive list of political prisoners, complied through <br/>the collaborative efforts of a wide range of  NGOs,  is  key to  clearly presenting the extent of <br/>Aliyev regime’s politically motivated human rights abuses to the international community.  <br/> <br/>Only  a  month  after  presenting  this  list  at  the  PACE  session,  and  immediately  following  the <br/>arrest  of  Leyla  Yunus,  Jafarov  was  taken  into  custody.  Prior  to  his  arrest,  Jafarov  was  also <br/>unlawfully banned from leaving the county, and his bank accounts were frozen.   <br/> <br/>Rasul Jafarov does not accept any of the charges filed against him and considers his arrest to <br/>be  due  to  his  human  rights  activities.

As a lawyer, he has <br/>filed  over  300  complaints  with  the <br/>European  Court  of  Human  Rights.    Of <br/>these,  23  cases  have  been  successfully <br/>completed.  Aliyev  has  taught  courses  on <br/>civics,  civil  procedure,  non-commercial <br/>law,  and  international  mechanisms  of <br/>human rights at local universities. He is an <br/>expert on the legal and human rights issues <br/>of <br/>
many <br/>
international <br/>
organizations <br/>
(OSCE, Council of Europe, GTZ, etc.) and <br/>has  authored  over  twenty  books.  On  4 <br/>March  2013,  he  was  given  an  award  by <br/>People <br/>
in <br/>
Need, <br/>
a <br/>
human <br/>
rights <br/>
organization.    Aliyev,  his  lawyers,  and  human  rights  activists  do  not  accept  the  charges <br/>against  him,  consider  them  be  politically  motivated,  and  link  his  arrest  to  his  human  rights <br/>activities. Aliyev has sent more than 40 complaints to the European Court in connection with <br/>the parliamentary elections of 2010; currently there are communications taking place with the <br/>government regarding the same complaints. Aliyev’s arrest serves the purpose of preventing <br/>the  European  Court  from  issuing  a  decision  against  Azerbaijan.  However,  the  Azerbaijani <br/>authorities  did  not  stop  there.  While  conducting  a  search  of  the  Legal  Education  Society’s <br/>offices, all documents relating to the aforementioned election case were illegally seized by the <br/>Investigative  Unit.  Authorities  believed  that  imprisoning  Aliyev  was  not  enough  to  prevent <br/>the files from making their way to the European Court, or being used by complainants against <br/>the  government.  (According  to  the  procedural  rules  of  the  European  Court,  it  is  possible  to <br/>remove a case from consideration due to lack of interest by the complainants.) In addition to <br/>cases  concerning  the  election,  Aliyev,  has  also  submitted  complaints  to  the  European  Court <br/>concerning violation of property rights, freedom of expression, and the right to assembly. The <br/>Investigative Unit has also illegally seized the files concerning those cases.  It should also be <br/>noted  that,  to  date,  the  majority  of  the  decisions  issued  by  the  European  Court  against  the <br/>Azerbaijani  government,  have  been  in  cases  litigated  by  Aliyev.  All  this  gives  way  to  the <br/>assertion that the primary reason for Aliyev’s arrest has to do with the complaints filed by him <br/>with the European Court. <br/> <br/>

 <br/>
During  his  speech  at  the  2014  summer  session  event  of  Parliamentary  Assembly  of  the <br/>Council  of  Europe,  Aliyev  harshly  criticized  the  government's  policy  on  human  rights,  and <br/>spoke  on  the  problem  of  political  prisoners,  attacks  on  independent  NGOs,  arrests  of <br/>government  critics  based  on  false  charges,  massive  violations  of  property  rights  of  citizens, <br/>and other such topics.  In this sense, his arrest is also a violation of freedom of expression.   <br/> <br/>One month prior to his arrest, a tax audit was conducted at Aliyev’s office and he was accused <br/>of tax evasion. However, no legal violations were discovered – the Legal Education Society, <br/>as well as Intiqam Aliyev himself, are registered with the taxation department. Therefore it is <br/>unclear  as  to  how  Aliyev  broke  the  law  by  taking  part  in  illegal  business  conduct,  as  the <br/>government claims.  <br/> <br/><i><b>On August 8, 2014, Nasimi District Court issued a three months pre-trial detention order in <br/>his case, despite his serious health problems. <br/></b></i> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>

<b>C.  YOUTH ACTIVISTS </b><br/>
<i><b> </b></i><br/>
<b>a.  The board members and activists of the “N!DA” civic movement  </b><br/>
<b> <br/><i>Brief Background on the “N!DA” movement <br/></i></b> <br/>The N!DA civic movement was founded in 2011 by a group of youth who wanted freedom, <br/>justice,  and  truth  in  Azerbaijan.  N!DA  has  stated  that  change  needs  to  take  place  in  the <br/>country and the government should be built on the will of the people. The main requirements <br/>of the  <br/> <br/>N!DA civic movement include the following:  <br/>
 <br/>  To live in a free and developed country; <br/>  An army consisting of persons with high fighting capacity; <br/>
  Change of the ruling regime in a democratic manner through free and fair voting; <br/>  Laws that are fair and equal for everyone; <br/>
  Free and independent media. <br/> <br/>N!DA  is  not  associated  with  any  political  party,  and  its  main  objective  is  to  achieve <br/>democratic  change through peaceful means.27 It  has organized various  actions, such as  flash <br/>mob  protests.  The  movement’s  board  members  have  been  represented  in  the  opposition <br/>coalition, the National Council, and N!DA members actively supported the campaign of Jamil <br/>Hasanli, the united opposition candidate. <br/> <br/>Members  of the N!DA  civic movement  have been persecuted in  a number of ways for their <br/>social activity and critical positions. Board member Zaur Gurbanli was detained in September <br/>2012 for distributing N!DA materials regarding the 2013 presidential election. No information <br/>was  given about  his  detention for two days. On 1 October 2012, police stated that Gurbanli <br/>had  been  arrested  in  a  drug  operation,  and  received  fifteen  days  of  administrative  detention <br/>for resisting police. In June 2013, Aygun Panjaliyeva, head of N!DA’s board, was fired from <br/>the school  where she was  employed as a  French  language teacher, due to pressure from the <br/>authorities.  Former  N!DA  activist  Omar  Mammadov  left  the  movement  due  to  pressure  on <br/>him and his family. He is now in detention in connection with his activity as a blogger. <br/><i> <br/><b>Arrest of members and activists of the N!DA civic movement</b> </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
 <br/>In protest of the deaths of young soldiers of the National Army during non-combat operations, <br/>young activists and the parents of the soldiers gathered on 12 and 26 January 2013 in central <br/>Baku. The police used excessive force to disperse the crowd, and hundreds of protesters were <br/>arrested. Most were sentenced to administrative detention or received high fines. These mass <br/>protests and the repression against the protesters drew much attention within the country and <br/>from  the  international  community.  However,  despite  the  successful  mobilization  efforts, <br/>deaths of soldiers in non-combat situations continued.<i> </i><br/>
<i> </i><br/>
 <br/>On 1 March 2013, representatives of a group of youth organizations, including N!DA, applied <br/>to  the  Baku  City  Executive  Authority,  expressing  their  intent  to  hold  a  mass  protest  on  10 <br/>March  2013.  To  prevent  this  protest  from  becoming  too  large,  as  a  precaution,  authorities <br/>began arresting N!DA members who were active previous demonstrations.<i> </i><br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>Three  activists  of  the  N!DA  civic  movement  –  Mammad  Azizov,  Bakhtiyar  Guliyev,  and <br/>Shahin  Novruzlu  –  were  arrested  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Security  on  the  evening  of  7 <br/>March 2013, ahead of the mass action planned for 10 March in central Baku, to again protest <br/>the  suspicious  deaths  of  soldiers  in  non-combat  situations.  The  activists’  parents,  relatives, <br/>and  friends  were  not  informed  about  the  arrests.  They  were  not  provided  with  access  to <br/>lawyers  either. A  few hours after the arrest,  the apartments  of Azizov, who lives  alone, and <br/>Guliyev  and  Novruzov,  who  live  with  their  families,  were  searched.  Police  claimed  to  have <br/>found  drugs  and  Molotov  cocktails  in  their  apartments.  Their  preliminary  interrogation  and <br/>delivery  of  pre-trial  detention  sentences  took  place  without  the  presence  of  their  lawyers. <br/>Since  Shahin  Novruzlu  was  underage  at  the  time  of  arrest,  his  legal  representative  by  law <br/>should have attended his interrogation. However, the investigation department did not fulfill <br/>this  legal  requirement.  All  three  youths  stated  in  their  preliminary  testimonies  that  they  had <br/>done nothing illegal. However, a day later, due to torture and psychological harassment, they <br/>were forced to testify against themselves and others without the presence of their lawyers. <br/> <br/>On  9  March  2013,  national  Azerbaijani  television  stations  aired  broadcasts  showing  the <br/>Azizov,  Guliyev,  and  Novruzlu  supposedly  admitting  their  intent  to  commit  a  crime  by <br/>creating confrontations using Molotov cocktails during the mass protest planned on 10 March <br/>2013.    The  broadcasts  showed  the  testimonies  of  the  three  against  board  members  of  the <br/>N!DA civic movement, including alleged confessions about their involvement in committing <br/>the crime. The broadcasts clearly showed that the youth were afraid and had been subjected to <br/>physical  violence.  The  broadcast  of  Soviet-era  confessional  videos  indicates  that  the  arrests <br/>were politically motivated.  <br/> <br/>A  short  while  later,  all  three  youths,  in  testimonies  given  in  the  presence  of  their  lawyers, <br/>stated that they had confessed under duress, and submitted appeals to the prosecutor’s office <br/>to  investigate  reports  of  torture.  In  addition,  the  employees  of  the  Ministry  of  National <br/>Security  who  arrested  the  activists,  spoke  as  additional  witnesses,  but  gave  unclear  and <br/>confused  answers  to  the  questions  of  the  youths  and  their  lawyers.  The  investigation  into <br/>these complaints  was  of a perfunctory nature, since the body that committed the torture and <br/>the body that investigated the matter was one and the same. Azizov, Guliyev, and Novruzlu, <br/>later  sued  the  Ministry  of  National  Security,  the  Prosecutor  General’s  Office,  and  several <br/>television stations. <br/>
 <br/>
Despite these arrests and the broadcasts, hundreds of people, including other activists of the <br/>N!DA civic movement,  joined the peaceful protest  on 10 March 2013, which was dispersed <br/>through the use of excessive force by police. <br/> <br/>The protest was followed by the arrests of board members of the movement. Board members <br/>Rashad Hasanov, Rashadat Akhundov, and Uzeyir Mammadli, as well as N!DA activist Zaur <br/>Gurbanli, were arrested in April 2013. The youth were first charged with illegal possession of <br/>explosives  and  drugs.  Six  months  after  their  arrest,  in  September  2013,  another  charge  was <br/>brought  against  them:  organizing  or  taking  part  in  mass  unrest.  When  the  new  charge  was <br/>introduced,  Anayat  Akhundov,  the  74  year-old  grandfather  of  Rashadat  Akhundov, <br/>committed suicide by slashing his wrists. He passed away several days later in the hospital.28 <br/> <br/>The  pre-trial  sentences  for  Hasanov,  Akhundov,  Mammadli,  and  Gurbanli  did  not  change <br/>until  the start  of the trial, which began on 6 November 2013,  and was ongoing at  this time.  <br/>

About ten years ago, he launched <br/>the first-ever political blog in Azerbaijan. Mammadov is the Director of the Baku School of <br/>Political  Studies  of  the  Council  of  Europe,  as  well  as  an  advisory  member  of  the  German <br/>Marshall Fund and Revenue Watch.30  <br/> <br/>Mammadov  is  also  the  Chairman  of  the  Republican  Alternative  (REAL)  movement,  which <br/>was established in 2009 and has become known as a new generation political force in recent <br/>years.  The  movement’s  main  objectives  are  to  transition  to  a  parliamentary  republic  and <br/>restore republican traditions in Azerbaijan; to build an effective government; and to guarantee <br/>rights  and  freedoms  to  all  Azerbaijanis.  Since  its  establishment,  REAL  has  proposed <br/>alternative  programs  in  addition  to  criticizing  current  government  policies  and  those <br/>implementing these policies, including President Aliyev. <br/> <br/>Following  the  referendum  of  2  March  2009  –  which  removed  the  provision  limiting  the  a <br/>president to serve only two terms in office – during a live program on ANS TV, Mammadov <br/>accused  President  Aliyev  of  following  the  path  of  Iranian  Shah  Reza  Pahlavi  by  removing <br/>presidential  term  limits.  Mammadov,  who  ran  in  the  2010  parliamentary  elections,  used  his <br/>airtime to criticize the ruling authorities for pursuing useless policies.  <br/> <br/>On 1 March 2012, Mammadov visited the city of Guba to observe mass protests taking place <br/>against the local executive head of the region. He criticized the authorities for these protests. <br/>In  November  2012,  Mammadov  criticized  parliament’s  ineffective  operations,  saying  that  it <br/>was comprised of MPs who had gained their seats through rigged elections. He described the <br/>parliament as a zoo. As a result, MP Adil Aliyev, who is connected to the ruling authorities, <br/>voiced a threat, saying in an interview that those who spoke like this needed to be beheaded. <br/>Ruling party MP Hadi Rajabli, the head of Parliament’s Committee on Social Policy, stated <br/>that an appeal for Mammadov’s arrest was ready to be submitted to the court, and that MPs <br/>continued to sign the appeal. No appeal was ever submitted. <br/> <br/>On  19  January  2013,  workers  at  the  Bina  Trade  Center  in  Baku  held  a  protest,  calling  for <br/>social change, which resulted in a confrontation with the police. Mammadov visited the scene <br/>of  the  protest,  met  with  protesters,  and  learned  of  their  demands.  Both  on  his  blog,  and  in <br/>interviews  with  the  media,  Mammadov  voiced  support  for  the  protesters,  stating  that  their <br/>                                                 <br/><a href="http://bit.ly/1fsL2aR">30 http://bit.ly/1fsL2aR </a><br/>

demands  were  justified.  He  openly  blamed  the  authorities  for  not  being  interested  in <br/>preventing corruption.  <br/> <br/>On 23 January 2013, protests were held in the Ismayilli region, demanding the resignation of <br/>the local executive head, which also resulted in clashes. On 24 January, a day after the protest, <br/>Mammadov  visited  the  Ismayilli  region.  After  talking  with  journalists  and  some  of  the <br/>residents  in  the  center of the region,  he returned  to  Baku.  On his  way to  Baku, Mammadov <br/>gave an interview to RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani service, stating that the protesters’ demands were <br/>reasonable. On his blog, he criticized the local executive bodies for challenging the people’s <br/>patience.  In  addition,  Mammadov  obtained  the  identities  of  those  who  caused  the <br/>confrontations. He identified them as relatives and close friends of then-Minister of Labor and <br/>Social Protection, Fuzuli Alakbarov. Mammadov obtained and publicized official documents <br/>indicating that the hotel run by people who caused the clashes was owned by the Minister’s <br/>son. Though at the time, the local executive head and other officials stated that the hotel did <br/>not belong to any official or their relatives. <br/> <br/>Mammadov  was  arrested  following  his  visit  to  Ismayilli.  Most  television  stations,  as  of  26 <br/>January,  quoted  the  statement  released  by  the  Office  of  the  Prosecutor  General  and  the <br/>Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs.  In  the  statement,  the  claim  was  made  that  Mammadov,  along <br/>with journalist and Deputy Head of the Musavat Party, Tofig Yagublu, incited the incidents in <br/>Ismayilli. In doing so, these stations violated Mammadov and Yagublu’s right to presumption <br/>of innocence by publically describing them as criminals. <br/> <br/>On 29 January, Mammadov was summoned to the Grave Crimes Investigation Department of <br/>the  Prosecutor  General’s  Office  where  he  was  questioned  over  the  Ismayilli  visit,  and  then <br/>released. On 4 February, he was again called to the department, and sentenced by the Nasimi <br/>District Court to two months of pre-trial detention. <br/> <br/>Mammadov had visited Ismayilli a day after the protest, not the day when the protest began. <br/>He  stayed  in  the  center  of  Ismayilli  city  only  for  about  40  to  50  minutes  with  a  number  of <br/>journalists and Natig Jafarli,  REAL Executive Secretary, who had traveled with  him. Jafarli <br/>and the journalists confirmed this during the trial. In addition, a video showed Mammadov in <br/>the city center, not calling for confrontation, but just talking to journalists. The video showed <br/>no  mass  action  or  violence.  Excerpts  from  mobile  phone  conversations  revealed  that <br/>Mammadov had already left the region during the time period when he was allegedly taking <br/>part in illegal activities. <br/> <br/>The  Ismayilli  residents  blamed  for  the  incidents  said  they  did  not  know  Mammadov.  Two <br/>residents,  Israfil  Verdiyev  and  Rovshan  Novruzov,  who  were  involved  in  the  cases  as <br/>witnesses,  claimed  that  they  saw  Mammadov  calling  on  youth  to  resist  police.  But  when <br/>questioned  by  lawyers,  the  witnesses  gave  conflicting  testimonies.  The  venue  where  the <br/>witnesses  claimed  Mammadov  was  staying  was  different  from  the  place  claimed  by  the <br/>investigation. A witness with the surname Mehdiyev said that he was at the scene by chance <br/>and  had  not  witnessed  anything  during  the  Ismayilli  protest.  But  the  case  materials  showed <br/>that Mehdiyev had already testified against those arrested on 23 January. The alleged victims <br/>stressed in their testimonies that they had no complaint against the defendants.  <i><b>However, on <br/>17 March 2014, Sheki Court of Grave Crimes sentenced Mammadov to seven years in jail. <br/> <br/></b></i>Amnesty  International  described  Mammadov’s  arrest  as  a  “politically  motivated <br/>prosecution,”31 and  recognizes  him  as  a  prisoner  of  conscience.32 The  PACE  co-rapporteurs <br/>                                                 <br/><a href="http://bit.ly/QnDAbI">31 http://bit.ly/QnDAbI </a><br/>

for Azerbaijan expressed concern over Mammadov’s arrest and visited him in detention while <br/>they were in Baku. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights underscored the <br/>necessity  of  Mammadov’s  release  in  a  report. 33  The  European  Parliament  passed  two <br/>resolutions calling for Mammadov’s immediate and unconditional release.  <br/> <br/>A month and a half after Mammadov’s arrest, the European Court of Human Rights received <br/>the appeal against Mammadov’s pre-trial detention sentence, and began communication with <br/>the Azerbaijani government. On 22 May 2014, the European Court of Human Rights revealed <br/>its decision regarding the complaint sent in connection with pre-trial detention of Mammadov <br/>– they stated that the Articles 5.1 and 5.4 (right to freedom), 6.2 (presumption of innocence) <br/>and 18 (limitations on use of restrictions on rights) in connection with Article 5 were violated. <br/>The pre-trial detention of Mammadov was ungrounded. In item 143 of the European Court of <br/>Human  Rights’  decision,  it  was  concluded  that  Igar  Mammadov  was  imprisoned  for  his <br/>critical political views. <br/>

Sadigov <br/>represented his party in Lankaran, where he lived. In January 2013, Sadigov organised a visit <br/>of the head of Musavat Party, Isa Gambar, to Lankaran, although Gambar was not allowed to <br/>enter  Lankaran as  a result of past   Sadigov  was  also  actively engaged in publicizing human <br/>rights violations and protecting the rights of citizens in other regions. <br/> <br/>Sadigov was charged with hooliganism, allegedly hitting a resident of Lankaran City, Rashid <br/>Karimov, with his mobile phone while at a teahouse. Sadigov was detained on the basis of a <br/>complaint filed by Karimov, and sentenced to a pre-trial detention. <i><b> <br/></b></i> <br/>The  complaint  filed  by  the  alleged  victim  was  published  by  AzerTag,  a  state-run  news <br/>agency, even before being released by the police. The complaint stated that Sadigov and two <br/>of his colleagues insulted Karimov, using inappropriate language when he was passing by the <br/>teahouse,  beating  and  kicking  him  in  public.  However,  the  complainant’s  testimony  during <br/>the investigation contradicted this; he claimed then that only Sadigov had beaten him. When <br/>questioned by lawyers during the trial, the complainant mainly answered, “I don’t remember.” <br/>In their testimonies, the alleged witnesses named a different teahouse than was mentioned in <br/>the  investigation  materials,  strongly  indicating  that  the  witnesses  were  coached  by  the <br/>prosecution.  In his  testimony, the owner of the  teahouse stated that he did  not  fully  witness <br/>the incident, only the complainant when he came to the teahouse later with police.

 <br/><b>a. Case of Said Dadashbayli and Those Arrested with Him<i> <br/></i></b>  <br/>Said Dadashbayli studied  at  Azerbaijan  State  Economic  University,  majoring  in  economics <br/>and  production  management.  He  worked  at  Azerbaijan  State  Oil  Company  from  1992  to <br/>1998, and has also worked for Azeri EM-AY Drilling Fluids, a joint Azerbaijan-US company <br/>as  a  coordinator  on  material-technical  supply.  The  Canadian  government  has  issued  him <br/>permanant residence due to his area of specialization. He is married and has two children. <br/>  <br/>On  13  January  to  18  January  2007  approximatly  30  people  were  arrested  in  the <br/>Said Dadashbayli case.  (Details  about  their  specific  charges  are  listed  below.)  Some <br/>were released, but only after testifying against the eleven defendants that were held at <br/>the Ministry of National Security detention facility.   <br/> <br/>There  were  serious  legal  violations  from  the  initial  round  of  arrests.  Ministry  of <br/>National  Security  officials entered  the  apartments  of  the  accused  by  force,  without <br/>presenting  search  permits.  Right  in  front  of  the  relatives  of  those  being  arrested, <br/>Ministry of National Security officials planted guns and other  material evidence in the <br/>apartments in order to justify the arrests. These are obviously in seriously violation of <br/>Azerbaijan’s Code of Criminal Procedure.  <br/> <br/>Detainees  were  also  not  allowed  to  contact  their  attorneys  in  initial  days  after  their <br/>arrest, or brought to the court during the  first seven months. There was no court ruling <br/>approving  their  arrest  during  the  investigation  period  and  none  of  the  arrests  were <br/>made official. The defendants were brought to the Court of Grief Crimes eight months <br/>after  their  arrest  on  17  September  2007.  Prior  to  the  trial,  the  accused  were  kept <br/>in individual  cells  at  the  Ministry  of  National  Security from  January  13,  2007  till <br/>December  11,  2007.  They  were  periodically  being  beaten;  deprived  of  sleep,  eating, <br/>and  drinking  water;  and  given psychotropic  substances.  Authorities  threatened  to  torture <br/>their relatives should the accused refuse to confess. <br/>  <br/>A  prisoner  named  Emin Mammadov passed  away  due  to  severe  torture  in  March of <br/>2007  –  there  is  a  medical  certificate  verifying  the  cause  of  death.  Mammadov's  death <br/>was hidden from his family and public for several months. When they did find out, his <br/>family  was  threatened  with  further  repression,  should  they  contact <br/>human  rights  defenders  or  try  to  go  public.  When  Mammadov’s <br/>attorney  submitted  an  inquiry  about  the  conditions  in  the  detention <br/>facility,  the  Ministry  of  National  Security  responded  that  they  had  no <br/>records of Emin Mammadov and he was never held there. After losing <br/>his  life  as  a  result  of  severe  torture,  Mammadov  was  not  even <br/>mentioned  during  the  court  proceedings.  For  the  court  and  the  public <br/>at large, “E. Mammadov” disappeared without a trace. <br/>  <br/>Court  sessions  were  closed  to  the  public  as  well  as  the  families  of  the <br/>accused.  According  to  Provision  200  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  of  Azerbaijan <br/>Republic,  court  sessions  can  be  conducted  closed  to  the  public  in  order  to  prevent  leaks  of <br/>state  secrets.  But  there  was  no  sensative  information  in  this  case,  and  no  legal  standing  for <br/>closed court proceedings.  <br/>

 <br/>The defendants did not accept the charges against them during the trial. They stated that they <br/>were  victims  of  torture  and  other  illegal  actions  committed  by  authorities.  The  court  found <br/>that  majority  of  the  defendants  charged  with  starting  terrorist  organizations  had  not  even <br/>known each other prior to meeting in prison. Prosecutors failed to provide sufficient evidence <br/>– the trial ended according to the will of the prosecutor. <br/> <br/>The case of this group is considered politically motivated, because:  <br/>
a)  The charges against them were political in nature. <br/>b)  The arrests and the case were aimed at strengthening the Azerbaijani government’s <br/>
image as combating terrorism and threats against Western countries and Israel; <br/>President Aliyev received appraise from high-level US officials for eliminating <br/>Dadashbeyli’s group.34 <br/>

 <br/><i><b> <br/>b. The Islamic Party of Azerbaijan: Movsum Samadov and those arrested with him.  <br/></b></i> <br/>The Islamic Party of Azerbaijan (IPA) was founded in 1991 in Baku and registered with the <br/>state in 1992. Although the IPA’s registration was revoked in 1995 by the Supreme Court, its <br/>activity was not actually banned. Thus the party is still operating without registration. When <br/>Haji Movsum Samadov was  elected as the Party  Chairman in  2007, the party applied to  the <br/>Minister of Justice for registration. The Ministry did not register the party. <br/> <br/>The IPA and Samadov stated that the requirements of Islam should be followed in Azerbaijan <br/>and  that  the  Azerbaijani  government  was  pursuing  an  anti-Islamic  policy.  The  party  and  its <br/>chairman also viewed the US and Israel as occupant countries. In an interview with an Iranian <br/>radio  station  in  December  2009,  Samadov  expressed  his  disappointment  regarding  the <br/>destruction  of  several  mosques  in  Azerbaijan,  and  condemned  amendments  that  had  been <br/>made  to  laws  regulating  religious  practices.  In  April  2010,  Samadov  sent  an  appeal  to <br/>President  Ilham  Aliyev,  reminding the President  that he had sworn an oath  to  the Koran,  as <br/>well as the constitution. In the appeal, Samadov stated that the President’s actions conflicted <br/>with both the constitution and the Koran.  <br/> <br/>Samadov  was  detained  at  a  peaceful  protest  in  front  of  the  Israeli  Embassy  in  Baku  on <br/>International Jerusalem Day. He was later set free. In protest to the articles published in <i>Alma</i> <br/>newspaper  about  Prophet  Mohammad  in  November  2010,  the  IPA  and  the  Caucasian <br/>Muslims Office sent an appeal to the Press Council. Later, the IPA appealed to the National <br/>Television and Radio Council stressing the need to remove the licentious television programs <br/>from the air. Although the IPA and Samadov stood in the 2010 parliamentary elections, it was <br/>no success.  <br/> <br/>IPA  activists  took  part  in  the  first  peaceful  protests  against  the  hijab  (headscarf)  ban  in <br/>schools  imposed  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  December  2010.  At  the  IPA  General <br/>Assembly held on 2 January 2011, Samadov made a speech criticizing Minister of Education <br/>Misir  Mardanov  for  the  hijab  ban,  and  President  Aliyev  for  the  social  situation  in  the <br/>country.35. In his speech, Samadov referred to articles from the<i> Washington Post </i>and the <i>New <br/>York  Times  </i>about  villas  in  Dubai,  reportedly<i>  </i>owned  by  the  president’s  son.  The  articles <br/>claimed  that  the  wealth  of  the  Azerbaijani  people  and  state  had  been  stolen;  there  were  no <br/>jobs for Azerbaijani youth despite the country’s great wealth; injustice and bribery ruled in to <br/>commemorate  the  birthday  of  former  President  Heydar  Aliyev,  was  essentially  stolen  from <br/>the people; and idolatry  was  promoted in  the country by idolizing Heydar Aliyev. Samadov <br/>claimed  that  the  Azerbaijani  people  should  remain  on  alert  and  should  change  the  ruling <br/>regime. He called on the people to rise against oppression. Samadov’s speech went viral on <br/>social media networks, particularly on YouTube, leading to broad discussions.  <br/> <br/>On  7  January  Samadov,  IPA  Deputy  Vagif  Abdullayev,  IPA  member  Elchin  Hasanov,  and <br/>Samadov’s driver, Mirhuseyn Kazimov, were arrested. Employees of the State Traffic Police <br/>stopped the car they were traveling in, and several plain-clothed people came out of a black <br/>car and took  Samadov and those with  him. The men were accused of resisting police. After <br/>being questioned at Narimanov District Police Station No. 19, they were taken to the Binagadi <br/>District  Court,  where  they  were  sentenced  to  ten  to  fifteen  days  of  administrative  detention <br/>(Samadov  was  sentenced  to  fourteen).  All  except  Samadov  were  taken  to  the  Binagadi <br/>

Temporary Detention Center. There was no information about Samadov’s whereabouts for a <br/>days; it was later reported that he was held at the Ministry of National Security. <br/> <br/>On the day of Samadov’s arrest, the Ministry of Internal Affairs released a statement saying <br/>that  the  Main  Department  to  Combat  Organized  Crime  carried  out  operations  based  on <br/>information  that  Samadov  and  his  cousin  from  the  Guba  region,  Dayanat  Samadov,  were <br/>calling for mass unrest, violation of public order, and Jihad. The statement went on to say that <br/>the aforementioned department had found three units of hand grenades in the electrical shop <br/>where  Dayanat  Samadov  worked,  and  seven  automatic  rifle  cartridges  in  his  house.  A <br/>criminal  case  was  subsequently  launched.  Another  IPA  activist,  Akhundzadeh,  as  well  as <br/>Dayanat  Samadov,  and  Haji  Samadov’s  brother-in-law  Firdovsi  Mammadrzayev,  and <br/>religious  attendees  of  the  2  January  General  Assembly  Faramiz  Abbasov  and  Zulfugar <br/>Mikayilzada, were all arrested. Arms and ammunition were reportedly found in their houses. <br/>Samadov and the others arrested with him faced charges of calling for the violent seizure of <br/>power  in  the  2  January  speech,  and  other  charges.  Upon  completion  of  administrative <br/>detention, Samadov and the others were sentenced to pre-trial detention. <br/> <br/>On  7  October  2011,  Baku  Court  of  Grave  Crimes  Judge  Eldar  Ismayilov  issued  a  decision <br/>sentencing  Movsum  Samadov  to  twelve  years  in  prison,  Akhundzada  to  11.5  years, <br/>Abdullayev and Abbasov to eleven years, and Mammadrzayev and Dayanat Samadov to ten <br/>years.. Mikayilzada was  sentenced to eleven  years of conditional imprisonment, with a five-<br/>year  trial  period.  The  Baku  Court  of  Appeals  upheld  the  decision  on  17 May  2012,  and  the <br/>Supreme Court upheld the decision on 21 February 2013. <br/> <br/>Observation of the court trials and examination of the final ruling reveals that Samadov had <br/>not  entered  into  any  criminal  relationship  with  those  arrested  with  him.  He  prepared  the <br/>speech he made on 2 January by himself. Deputy IPA Chairman Abdullayev, head of the IPA <br/>Astara branch Akhundzada, and religious followers Abbasov and Mikayilzada, only <i>heard</i> the <br/>speech at the event. Unlike what the investigation claimed, Samadov stated that he did not use <br/>the word “Jihad” in his speech, and that just like other opposition politicians, he had criticized <br/>the authorities and called on the public to fight for the values they believed in. <br/>  <br/>The  evidence  used  by  the  court  was  based  on  documents  and  testimonies  provided  by  law-<br/>enforcement agencies. Most of the witnesses who testified against the defendants during the <br/>investigation withdrew their testimonies during the trial,  stating that they had initially  given <br/>statements  under  pressure.  However,  the  court  attributed  the  change  in  testimonies  to  the <br/>influence  of  third  parties.  Although  the  protocol  from  the  alleged  discovery  of  arms  in  the <br/>shop where Dayanat  Samadov worked named  “Rasim Mukhtar oglu  Guloglanov” as a case <br/>witness,  it  was  later  revealed  in  court  that  the  witness’s  real  name  was  “Taleh  Rasim  oglu <br/>Piroglanov.” Another case witness, Hazrat Aliyev, said that he signed the search protocol in <br/>the police department, not at the search venue. He could not explain why he had gone to the <br/>police department. <br/> <br/>Witness  Ilham  Sharafaddinov,  who  allegedly  heard  Dayanat  Samadov’s  conversation  with <br/>Mammadrzayev in a mosque in Guba, did not recognize Mammadrzayev at the trial.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another  witness,  Natig  Mammadov,  who  claimed  that  he  heard  the  same  conversation, <br/>provided  his  military  service  certification  to  the  investigation  instead  of  his  identification <br/>card. The court did not pay any attention to this issue, which calls into question the witness’ <br/>identification. The witness, who claimed to be a religious follower who regularly visited the <br/>mosque in Guba, failed to answer even the simplest religious questions regarding the parts of <br/>

 <br/>
Islamic prayer, and did not know what month Ramadan was. The case materials contained no <br/>evidence  proving  that  Samadov  and  the  others  worked  against  the  national  interests  of  the <br/>Azerbaijani state or cooperated with Iranian intelligence services or other bodies. <br/>
 <br/>
Abdullayev, who had serious health problems, was transferred to prison No. 12 - a prison with <br/>serious detention conditions. Despite multiple appeals from him and his lawyers regarding his <br/>inability  to  withstand  these  conditions  and  deterioration  of  his  health,  Abdullayev  was  not <br/>released. Consequently, Abdullayev passed away in the Treatment Facility of the Penitentiary <br/>Service in July 2012. <br/>
 <br/>
Akhundzada, who has  serious  health problems,  suffered  an acute myocardial <br/>infarction  in  May  2013.  Multiple  appeals  stressing  the  need  for  his  release <br/>have  been  ignored.  Because  of  his  health  problems,  he  has  repeatedly  been <br/>transferred to the Treatment Facility of the Penitentiary Service, the last time <br/>being on 25 February 2014. <br/>

<i><b>c.  Cases of religious activists arrested in May 2012 </b></i><br/>
<i><b> <br/></b></i>Nine people were arrested in connection with the case against journalist Nijat Aliyev, which <br/>is detailed in the first section of this report. Some of these are youths who, like Nijat Aliyev, <br/>believed  that  an  LGBT  parade  could  be  held  in  Baku  on  the  eve  of  the  Eurovision  Song <br/>Contest in May 2012, and considered this as unacceptable according to Islam. These activists <br/>also had attended the peaceful protest against the hijab ban in schools in late 2010. Some had <br/>published articles on the website that Aliyev edited and assisted to disseminate information. <br/> <br/>Along  with  Aliyev,  the  activists  decided  to  clearly  express  their  position  by  protesting  the <br/>destruction  of  houses  in  the  run-up  to  Eurovision,  (which  had  been  destroyed  without  due <br/>compensation  or  an  official  court  order),  as  well  as  the  trumped-up  arrests  of  religious <br/>followers,  and  the  issues  of  the  LGBT  parade.  They  prepared  CDs  with  speeches  of <br/>theologians  Abgul  Suleymanov  and  Tale  Bagirov  (both  of  whom  are  in  prison  under  false <br/>charges), a speech by Azerbaijan Medical University teacher Rashid Mammadov that aired on <br/>ANS TV, which was about LGBT issues, as well as excerpts from various protests on social <br/>issues,  and  scenes  from  some  Azerbaijani  movies.  As  noted  in  the  court ruling,  they  spread <br/>these CDs “publicly” at various places in Baku. In their testimonies in the trial, the defendants <br/>said they had been attempting to express their positions in this way. <br/> <br/>An expert from the State Committee on Work with Religious Organizations issued a report on <br/>28 June 2012, stating that the content of the untitled CDs, as well as those titled “Eurovision <br/>1,”  propagated  intolerance  and  hatred  against  the  state  structure  and  state  bodies,  and  were <br/>aimed at sparking confrontation. The court did not grant the motion requesting an independent <br/>examination  of  the  CDs.  In  addition,  expert  Nahid  Gadir  oglu  Mammadov  failed  to  explain <br/>what methodology had been used in the examination, and how he came to the conclusion that <br/>the  content  was  of  a  negative  nature.  To  most  questions  he  gave  answers  such  as  “I  don’t <br/>remember,” and “I have forgotten.” Stating that the expert was not ready to answer questions, <br/>the  lawyers  requested  additional  time  for  him  to  prepare,  but  the  judge  did  not  grant  the <br/>motion and announced that the questioning had concluded. <br/> <br/>The evidence  provided by  the investigation on other charges brought  against  the defendants <br/>included the testimonies of police employees and case witnesses. But conflicting points in the <br/>testimonies came out during questioning in the trial. <br/> <br/>Nijat Aliyev and Elvin Nasirov were subject to torture at the time of their arrests. As a result, <br/>two of Aliyev’s teeth were broken, and his eardrum was injured. Although both reported this <br/>in  the  trial,  the  judge  decided  only  to  address  a  letter  to  the  Baku  Investigative  Prison  to <br/>examine whether there  was  evidence of torture  on their bodies at  the time of transfer to  the <br/>prison. The letter received from the prison said there was not. <br/> <br/>Initially,  two  of  the  defendants,  Valeh  Abdullayev  and  Ali  Aliyev,  were  not  sentenced  to  a <br/>pre-trial  detention,  but  they  signed  a  statement  committing  not  to  travel.  However,  in <br/>contradiction with standard practices, the court did not sentence them to conditional arrest. <br/> <br/><b>50.

<i><b>d.  Cases of religious activists arrested in the Masalli region </b></i><br/>
<i><b> </b></i><br/>
Six  religious followers living in the Masalli region were arrested along with journalist Araz <br/>Guliyev, whose case is detailed in the first section of this report. Some are friends of Guliyev, <br/>one  (Nijat  Aliyev)  is  a  relative  of  his,  and  the  others  are  his  acquaintances.  Some  of  these <br/>people  helped  Guliyev  to  collect  information  for  the  website  he  edited,  www.xeber44.com. <br/>

 <br/>
Some  had  also  attended  the  peaceful  protest  against  the  hijab  ban  in  late  2010.  Of  those <br/>arrested, only Ziya Tahirov was near Guliyev on the day of his arrest. Rza Agali was arrested <br/>on 6 September 2012, like Guliyev. The others were arrested on different dates. Nonetheless, <br/>they were all found guilty of throwing stones at people during a disco party held as part of a <br/>folklore  festival  in  the  Masalli  region,  as  well  as  other  charges.  There  is  no  doubt  that  they <br/>were arrested for helping Guliyev. Their arrest was also intended to make the charge against <br/>Guliyev more serious, by claiming that the crime was committed by an organized group. <br/> <br/>During  the  trial,  the  doubtful  and  questionable  testimonies  against  the  defendants  were <br/>accepted  as  more  reliable  evidence  than  testimonies  given  in  their  favor.  For  instance,  only <br/>one witness, Hajali Javadov, claimed that Kazimov was at the scene of the incident, while the <br/>other witnesses who were reportedly there at the same time, said they had not seen Kazimov. <br/>Moreover,  the  search,  which  allegedly  uncovered  narcotic  substances  in  Kazimov’s  house, <br/>was  conducted  without  his  or  his  lawyer’s  presence.  The  final  court  verdict  does  not  show <br/>what concrete crimes the defendants committed. The court issued long-term prison sentences <br/>to  those  illegally  arrested  in  this  incident.  The  fact  that  some  of  in  Guliyev  circle  were <br/>charged with forming criminal groups, and that this charge was not brought <br/>against other defendants who were found guilty for the same incident, shows <br/>that the indictment was drafted hastily and under false grounds. <br/>  <br/><i><b> <br/> <br/></b></i><b>59.

<i><b>e.  Cases of those detained in connection with the “Freedom for hijab” protest held on </b></i><br/>
<i><b>5 October 2012 <br/> </b></i><br/>
In  the  autumn  of  2010,  the  Ministry  of  Education  imposed  a  ban  preventing  schoolchildren <br/>wearing  the  hijab  (headscarf)  from  entering  schools.  This  led  to  disappointment  among <br/>religious Azerbaijanis, resulting in various campaigns and protests. Following a small protest <br/>held in December 2010 against the hijab ban, the first mass mobilization against the ban took <br/>place  on  6  May  2011  in  front  of  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  peaceful  protest  was <br/>dispersed by police and plain-clothed employees of law-enforcement agencies. As a result, a <br/>high number of protesters were detained. Twelve of them received imprisonment terms from <br/>1.5 to three years, and charged with hooliganism and violation of public order with no proof. <br/>Some of the detainees, who served their sentences or received early release, are not included <br/>in  this  report.  Nonetheless,  the  Legal  Protection  and  Awareness  Society  considers  them  as <br/>former political prisoners, and can provide further information to those who are interested. <br/> <br/>The second mass protest took  place before the  Ministry of Education on 5 October 2012 (5 <br/>October  is  celebrated  as  the  Day  of  Teachers  in  Azerbaijan,  and  this  day  was  selected <br/>symbolically to draw attention to the situation). Police efforts to disperse the peaceful action <br/>through force led to confrontations. Consequently, the number of detainees exceeded that of <br/>those  arrested  on  6  May  2011.  Both  protesters  and  police  employees  sustained  physical <br/>injuries. All persons arrested for attending the protest are included in this list. <br/> <br/>Observation  and  analysis  of  photos  and  videos  of  the  protest  show  that  the  action  was <br/>peaceful and protesters refrained from confronting the police and the plain-clothed employees <br/>of other law-enforcement agencies. But after the use of force by police, some of the protesters <br/>attempted to defend themselves. The photos and videos clearly showed that the provocateurs <br/>were  posing  as  protesters,  throwing  wooden  sticks  bearing  protest  slogans  and  imitating <br/>resistance of law enforcement. This was done to fuel claims that the action was not peaceful. <br/>None of the provocateurs, who are clearly seen in the photos and videos, have been detained. <br/>But  all others  –    even those whose faces were only shown in  photos  and videos, those who <br/>had not resisted police, and those who were late to the protest – were detained and imprisoned <br/>under  court  order.  The  main  evidence  cited  when  issuing  the  court  decisions  were  police <br/>testimonies. But  questions  regarding the reliability of the testimonies have arisen due to  the <br/>fact that these police were on the opposing side during the protest. The owners of shops and <br/>taxi drivers operating around the Ministry of Education, who were involved as witnesses, said <br/>that they had not seen the defendants at all. The punishment for the police violence against the <br/>peaceful protesters in this case was inadequate. <br/> <br/>Information  about  those  arrested  for  participating  in  the  protest  was  not <br/>publicized for a long while. Their trials were held in groups. <br/><i><b> <br/> <br/> <br/></b></i><b>65.

A few days following his return to the Barda region, information was <br/>spread  about  police  searches  for  Hasanov,  (although  police  had  not  even  visited  his  house). <br/>After  dissemination  of  this  information,  Hasanov  voluntarily  went  to  the  Barda  Regional <br/>Police Department, saying that he was in Barda. While Hasanov was being questioned at the <br/>police  station  with  regard  to  his  participation  in  the  protest,  police  employees  went  to  his <br/>house  to  get  the  keys  to  his  car  from  his  father.  Hasanov’s  father  only  gave  them  the  keys <br/>after calling Hasanov himself. After the search, it was stated that a weapon had been found in <br/>the  car,  and  24  packets  of  narcotic  substances  in  Hasanov’s  pocket,  all  while  he  was <br/>voluntarily present  at  the police station. The testimonies of the police and case witnesses in <br/>the trial contained many conflicting statements to their initial testimonies. For instance, when <br/>

Suleymanov,  who  has  taught  the  Koran  and  Islam  since  2001, <br/>helped to establish the National Moral Values Public Union in 2005. The same year, he took <br/>an  active  part  in  the  protest  held  in  front  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  against  Danish <br/>cartoons of the Prophet  Mohammad. Suleymanov also  took  part in  peaceful protests held  in <br/>front of the Israeli Embassy in Baku on International Jerusalem Day each year between 2006 <br/>and 2010. Following a decision issued by the Economic Court related to the destruction of the <br/>Fatimeyi-Zahra  mosque  in  2009,  Suleymanov  organized  a  peaceful  protest  in  front  of  the <br/>Baku  City  Executive  Committee.  He  also  made  a  number  of  speeches  from  2009  to  2010 <br/>severely criticizing the destruction of other mosques. The religious activist took part in both <br/>protests against the hijab ban in schools (imposed by the Ministry of Education in late 2010). <br/>He  spoke  to  the  media,  calling  the  decision  illegal.  Facing  persecution  after  the  May  2011 <br/>protest against the hijab ban, Suleymanov was arrested in August 2011.  <br/> <br/>On 12 August  2011, the Ministry of National  Security  (MNS) and the Prosecutor General’s <br/>Office  released  a  joint  statement  claiming  Suleymanov,  journalist  Ramin  Jahangir  oglu <br/>Bayramov, and Azerbaijan Islamic Party member Arif Gulsuvar oglu Ganiyev were suspected <br/>of assisting a foreign state and its delegates in conducting enmity against Azerbaijan, as well <br/>as  inciting  mass  unrest  and  violation  of  public  safety,  and  encouraging  people  toward <br/>disobedience. The statement goes on to say that Suleymanov, with financial support from the <br/>Baku-based Cultural Center of the Islamic Republic of Iran, created and led a radical religious <br/>group called “Jafari”  without official state  registration. Group members allegedly  promoted <br/>religious  radicalism  and  organized,  prepared,  and  distributed  pamphlets,  that  propogated <br/>religious division and discrimination, to religious followers. The website<a href="http://www.i̇slam-azeri.az/"> www.İslam-Azeri.az <br/></a>was allegedly created by a so-called “Jafari radical religious  group” to promote propaganda, <br/>with Ramin Bayramov assigned to take the lead on the website. <br/> <br/>All  three  were  sentenced  to  pre-trial  detention.  Although  they  were  subjected  to  a  joint <br/>investigation, their trials were conducted separately, in conflict with the statement released on <br/>12 August. The district  courts sentenced Ramin Bayramov and Arif Ganiyev to 1.5  years in <br/>jail (Ramin Bayramov was recognized by Amnesty International as a prisoners of conscience; <br/>both men have since been released). But Suleymanov’s case was heard by the Baku Court of <br/>Grave Crimes. The trial  started in  August  2012. The last decision about Suleymanov’s pre-<br/>trial detention was issued by the Sabayil District Court on 6 April 2012. The decision stated <br/>that  his  pre-trial  detention  was  extended  to  11  May  2012  –  Suleymanov  was  detained  in <br/>prison for three months (from May to August 2012) illegally, without a court decision. <br/> <br/><i><b>Suleymanov was sentenced to eleven years in jail under a 10 August 2012 decision issued <br/>by Baku Court  of Grave Crimes.</b></i> Baku Court of Appeals Judge Mirpasha Huseynov upheld <br/>the sentence on 23 January 2013. <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/> The court investigators has no grounds for claimings that drugs were found on Suleymanov <br/>and in his house, and that the drugs allegedly found were not intended for sale. In addition, an <br/>expert  issued  an  opinion  saying  that  Suleymanov  was  not  a  drug  user.  The  court,  however, <br/>believed  the  Ministry  of  National  Security  employees  and  case  witnesses  gave  conflicting <br/>testimonies  without  being  fully  aware  of  the  issue.  The  court  was  not  interested  in  further <br/>investigation into the matter. One of the charges brought against Suleymanov was connected <br/>with  the  peaceful  protest  against  the  hijab  ban  at  schools  held  on  10  December  2010.. <br/>Although dozens of protesters were arrested at the time, most of them were later released, but <br/>some  were  sentenced  to  administrative  detention.  No  one  else  was  criminally  charged.  The <br/>fact  that Suleymanov  alone was  indicted for this action indictaes that  he  was persecuted  for <br/>his  political  activities,  and  that  the  charge  is  false.  The  charge  regarding  incitement  of <br/>national,  social  or  religious  hatred  with  the  use  of  violence  or  the  threat  of  violence  is <br/>connected to his November 2010 speech in the mosque. In his speech, Suleymanov criticized <br/>the destruction of mosques and the hijab ban at schools, and stressed the need to hold protests <br/>against  it.  This  speech  was  filmed  by  attendees  and  later  posted  on  social  networking  sites. <br/>The investigators assessed the call for protest as a call for the use of violence. But they could <br/>not prove that Suleymanov’s speech was indeed an expressions of hatred. <br/>  <br/>The issues noted in the joint statement of the Ministry of National Security and the Prosecutor <br/>General’s  Office  that  were  released  on  12  August  2011,  particularly  the  accusations  of  the <br/>establishment  of  a  criminal  group,  that  the  group  had  received  instructions  from  Iran,  the <br/>operation  of  Bayramov’s  website,  and  other  issues  of  this  kind,  were  not  covered  in  the <br/>investigation  or  the  trial.  This  shows  that  Suleymanov  was  arrested  hastily  and  under  a <br/>political order. ( The statement still remains on the Ministry’s website).38 <br/> <br/>Although Suleymanov was initially sent to Prison No.13, he was soon transferred to a single <br/>cell. Prison management introduced petitions claiming that Suleymanov had violated internal <br/>order  in  the  prison.  Based  on  these  petitions,  Garadagh  District  Court  Judge  Fuad  Hasanov <br/>issued a decision on 24 April 2013 (a month after Suleymanov was transferred to the prison), <br/>to  transfer  Suleymanov  to  the  Gobustan  Closed  Prison,  (which  has  grave  detention <br/>conditions)  for  six  months.  As  a  result  of  the  appeals  of  this  decision,  Suleymanov  was  not <br/>transferred to Gobustan Prison. But he was transferred to Prison No. 8, which not much better <br/>than Gobustan, in January 2014 to serve the remainder of his term. <br/>

<i><b>g. The “Nurchu”/Nursist case <br/></b></i> <br/>Criminal  case  #1086  was  initiated  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Security.  On  April  12  2014, <br/>Ismayil Mammadov Isakh and Eldaniz Hajiyev Balamat were detained, and on 14 April 2014 <br/>the court issued a decision for a two months pre-trial detention23 . In May 2014, another of <br/>the accused, Ravan Sabzaliyev Hakim, was placed in pre-trial detention for two months. The <br/>pre-trial  detentions  of  all  three  men  were  extended  for  two  more  months.  According  to  the <br/>case  documents,  several  residents  of  Baku  reported  to  police  that  religious  community <br/>members  were  gathering  at  different  times  in  a  house  in  their  neighborhood,  disturbing  the <br/>comfortable life they tried to lead.  <br/> <br/>On the very same day, joint forces  of the Ministry  of National  Security  and the Ministry of <br/>Internal Affairs conducted an operation and detained individuals in the house, while they were <br/>reading  books  and  praying.  The  charges  read  that  three  people  violated  other’s  rights  by <br/>reading  the  religious  verses.  They  were  also  accused  of  involving  two  minors  in  these <br/>activities.  The  fact  that  two  government  ministries  demonstrated  such  a  rapid  reaction  to  a <br/>mundane complaint made by neighborhood residents, suggests that the operation was planned <br/>in advance, with an intention to detain those reading and praying at any stake.  <br/> <br/>The intention of the religious group was to promote the “Sungurchu” branch of the “Nurchu” <br/>(Nursist) movement, which is based on the books of the Sunni author, Said Nursi. Although <br/>the men were peaceful in their activities, and there was no evidence or even a possibility that <br/>they  used  violence  or  violated  the  law,  all  of  them  were  immediately  placed  in  pretrial <br/>detention.  Article  168.2  of  the  Criminal  Code,  which  all  three  accused  are  charged  with, <br/>includes sanctions of fines or imprisonment of up to three years as a severe punishment. The <br/>hasty arrest of the accused, lack of evidence in the case documents, negligence on the part of <br/>the court to acknowledge those facts, strongly indicates that the men were prosecuted because <br/>of  their  religious  views.  Expert  examination  of  the  literature  found  in  possession  of  these <br/>individuals, concluded that the books read and distributed in the group did not carry a content <br/>that were in violation of the law.  <br/> <br/><b>84.

<b>F.  LIFETIME PRISONERS </b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
<b>a.  Cases of former Special Purpose Police Detachment (SPPD) members </b><br/>
<b> <br/></b>The Special Purpose Police Detachment was established based on the Takamul (“Evolution”) <br/>Party, founded by Rovshan Javadov and his  brother Mahir Javadov in  1987. Because of the <br/>war between Azerbaijan and Armenia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and due to <br/>separatist  developments  in  Nagorno-Karabakh  in  1988,Javadov  ordered  the  militarization  of <br/>the party. Following initial battles in the war, Javadov rose to the rank of colonel, and his unit <br/>was named the “Special Purpose Police Detachment” (SPPD). In 1991, SPPD members were <br/>awarded  the  title  of  “National  Heroes”  for  their  role  in  the  war.  In  1993,  Javadov  was <br/>appointed  by  former  President  Heydar  Aliyev  (father  of  President  Ilham  Aliyev),  to  the <br/>position of Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs. Javadov had played a crucial role in Heydar <br/>Aliyev coming to power.  <br/> <br/>However,  shortly  thereafter,  serious  disagreements  emerged  between  Javadov  and  Heydar <br/>Aliyev,  and  gradually  escalated.  In  January  1995,  Elchin  Amiraslanov,  newly  appointed <br/>Commander of the Gazakh branch of the SPPD, and members of SPPD Gazakh, stopped the <br/>smuggling  of  oil  from  the  Shikli  village  of  the  Gazakh  region  to  Armenian  territory.  They <br/>handed  over  22  tankers  to  the  Gazakh  Regional  Police  Department.  Amiraslanov  made  a <br/>speech  on  a  state-run  television  station  criticizing  the  decision  not  to  detain  those  who  had <br/>attempted  to  move  oil  into  Armenia.  Following  this,  the  conflicts  between  SPPD  members <br/>and Heydar Aliyev grew to become an open fight. On 13 March 1995, there was an attack on <br/>the  SPPD  Gazakh  branch,  and  a  bloody  battle  ensued.  On  14  March,  Minister  of  Internal <br/>Affairs Ramil Usubov (who remains minister to this day), issued an order to discharge SPPD <br/>and seize their arms within three days. However, an armed confrontation took place between <br/>interior troops and SPPD members on the night of 16 March near the SPPD Baku office. As a <br/>result, Rovshan Javadov passed away in the hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs due to <br/>the heavy wounds he sustained. <br/> <br/>This incident was followed by countrywide arrests of SPPD members. The arrested, and later <br/>imprisoned, SPPD members were charged with revolting, in addition to committing murders <br/>over a number of  years.  Imprisoned SPPD members either passed  away in custody, or were <br/>released  from  prison  under  pardon  decrees  in  the  following  years,  as  political  or  presumed <br/>political  prisoners.  The  last  pardon  decree  resulted  in  the  release  of  former  SPPD  member <br/>Shamsi Abdullayev in December 2012. Nonetheless, there are still several SPPD members in <br/>prison. <br/> <br/>According to the main charge brought against the prisoners, Safa Poladov and Arif Kazimov, <br/>under the instructions of Elchin Amiraslanov, killed the regional Police Chief in Gazakh, and <br/>the  Gazakh-Agstafa  Chief  of  the  Ministry  of  National  Security  at  a  restaurant  called <br/>“Akasiya,” located in the Gazakh region. Amiraslanov was also charged with participating in <br/>the  murder  of  Special  Office  Chief  Shamsi  Rahimov,  and  Deputy  Head  of  the  National <br/>Assembly  Afiyaddin  Jalilov.  Although  all  three  defendants  were  charged  with  high  treason <br/>and sentenced to death, there was lack of evidence to substantiate these charges. The relatives <br/>of  the  victims  stated  that  they  had  no  complaints  against  the  prisoners,  and  said  that  the <br/>accused  men  had  not  killed  their  relatives.  Instead,  the  relatives  said  that  the  murders  had <br/>been in connection with the investigation into the transfer of oil to Armenia. <br/> <br/>
<hr/>
<a name=76></a>76 <br/>
 <br/>
Nonetheless,  Amiraslanov,  Kazimov,  and  Poladov  were  given  the  death  penalty  by  the <br/>Supreme Court of Azerbaijan on 28 November 1997, based on the Criminal  Code approved <br/>under the 8 December 1960 law of the Azerbaijan SSR. At the time, the law did not allow for <br/>appeal against the decision. Amiraslanov was sentenced to fifteen years in prison during a 22 <br/>September 2000 ruling of the Supreme Court. The ruling incorporated his previous sentence <br/>of  life  in  prison,  which  replaced  his  initial  sentence  of  the  death  penalty  When  Azerbaijan <br/>abolished the death penalty in 1998, Amiraslanov’s initial sentence to death, was replaced by <br/>life in prison.  <br/> <br/>In interviews and articles in the media between 2010 and 2011, former Minister of National <br/>Security, officer Ramin Nagiyev, (now living abroad under political  asylum), stated that the <br/>murders,  which  were  claimed  to  have  been  committed  by  SPPD  members,  were  actually <br/>committed  by  former  Head  Operation  Officer  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  Main <br/>Criminal  Search  Office,  Haji  Mammadov,  who  was  arrested  in  2005.  Nagiyev  had  been  a <br/>member of the investigation team looking into the murder of Shamsi Rahimov and Afiyaddin <br/>Jalilov,  before  he  was  expelled  from  the  investigation  in  1995  with  no  reason  given. 39 <br/>Nagiyev’s statements have not been officially dismissed.  <br/><b> <br/><i>Lifetime imprisonment sentence could not have been applied. </i></b><br/>
<b> </b><br/>
On 10 February 1998, the National Assembly passed a law amending the Criminal Code, the <br/>Criminal  Procedure  Code,  and  the  Correction-Labor  Code,  abolishing  the  death  penalty  in <br/>Azerbaijan. Article 4 of this law states that the punishment of those sentenced to death prior <br/>to the law taking force, shall be replaced with a sentence of life in prison. However, replacing <br/>death penalty sentences with life in prison contradicts other legislation. <br/> <br/>According to  Article 147 of the Constitution  of Azerbaijan, adopted on  12 November 1995, <br/>the  Constitution  has  the  highest  legal  power  in  Azerbaijan.  The  Constitution  serves  as  the <br/>basis of the country’s legislative system. According to the seventh item of Article 149 of the <br/>Constitution, normative-legal acts improving the legal situation of physical persons and legal <br/>entities,  eliminating  or  mitigating  their  legal  responsibility,  have  reverse  power.  Other <br/>normative-legal acts have no reverse power.  <br/> <br/>According to Article 23 of the Criminal Code, under which the SPPD members were charged, <br/>when the death penalty was replaced with imprisonment through pardon, the prison sentence <br/>could be more than fifteen years, but no more than twenty years. As such, the replacement of <br/>the  death  penalty  with  sentences  of  life  in  prison  for  the  SPPD  members  far  exceeds <br/>alternative punishments envisaged in the 8 December 1960 law of the Azerbaijani SSR, under <br/>which  they  were  charged.  That  is,  according  to  the  Criminal  Code  approved  under  the  8 <br/>December 1960 law of Azerbaijani SSR, if the death penalty is annulled in any manner (such <br/>as through pardon), that penalty could be replaced with an imprisonment term for more than <br/>fifteen  years,  but  not  more  than  twenty  years.  In  the  case  of  the  SPDD  members,  the  death <br/>penalty  should  have  been  replaced  with  a  maximum  sentence  of  20  years  of  imprisonment. <br/>Additionally, according to  Item 7 of Article 149  of the Constitution, the National  Assembly <br/>should  not  have  replaced  the  death  penalty  sentence  under  the  10  February  1998  law.  The <br/>1998  law  worsened  the  legal  state  of  the  prisoners,  therefore  the  amended  sentences  should <br/>have been made under the Criminal Code of 8 December 1960. Furthermore, the 10 February <br/>1998  law,  which  replaced  the  death  penalty  sentences  of  the  SPPD  members  with  life  in <br/>prison, became null on 1 September 2000, when the new Criminal Code took effect. <br/> <br/>                                                 <br/><a href="http://bit.ly/1f0C3kt">39 http://bit.ly/1f0C3kt </a><br/>

<i><b>The Council of Europe considers these persons to be political prisoners <br/></b></i><b> <br/></b>On 31 January 2001, a few days after Azerbaijan and Armenia joined the Council of Europe <br/>on 25 January, the Committee of Ministers approved an initiative of Secretary General Walter <br/>Schwimmer  concerning  the  assignment  of  three  independent  experts  to  investigate  a  list  of <br/>716  presumed  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan.  The  Secretary  General  appointed  these <br/>experts  in  February  2001.  In  July  2001,  the  experts  presented  a  report  covering  the <br/>conclusions  of  the  investigations  concerning  the  presumed  political  prisoners  in  Azerbaijan <br/>and Armenia. Item 19 of this report contained a list of 23 persons (due to time constraints and <br/>a lack of data, only these cases were investigated), whose cases were assessed by the group of <br/>experts  and  determined  to  be  political  prisoners  or  not.  Amiraslanov  and  Kazimov  were  on <br/>this  list,  and  were  considered  to  be  political  prisoners.40 The  Parliamentary  Assembly  of <br/>Council  of  Europe  (PACE)  adopted  Resolution  No.  1272  on  “Political  Prisoners  in <br/>Azerbaijan”  on  24  January  2002.  In  Item  10  of  this  Resolution,  PACE  called  on  the <br/>Azerbaijani  government  to  release Amiraslanov and Kazimov, along with  the other political <br/>prisoners.41 <br/> <br/>Continuing their activity under their new mandate, the independent experts, in their report of <br/>12 May 2003, concluded that Poladov was also a political prisoner.42 On 27 January 27 2004, <br/>PACE  adopted  Resolution  No.  1359  on  “Political  Prisoners  in  Azerbaijan,”  and  in  this <br/>document,  PACE  called  for  the  release  of  the  persons  considered  to  be <br/>political  prisoners  by  independent  experts.43 In  follow-up  to  Resolution <br/>No. 1359, PACE adopted a report on 31 May 2005. Item 26 of this report <br/>stresses  that  three  persons  determined  to  be  political  prisoners  by  the <br/>independent  experts  –  Amiraslanov,  Kazimov,  and  Poladov  –  still <br/>remained in prison, and expressed concern over this.44 <br/> <br/>Documents  adopted  by  PACE  in  the  following  years  continued  to  stress  that  the  three  men <br/>were political prisoners. A large number of political prisoners, who were not assessed by the <br/>independent group of experts, were released from prison in the following years. Although the <br/>life  sentence  of  another  SPPD  member  Dayanat  Karimov,  as  well  as  that  of  former  Prime <br/>Minister Surat Huseynov’s cousin, Karamat Karimov, were replaced with 25 years in prison <br/>under  a  pardon  decree,  Amiraslanov,  Kazimov,  and  Poladov  did  not  receive  the  same <br/>treatment.  <br/> <br/>All three prisoners have applied to the European Court of Human Rights. They have serious <br/>health  problems.  Amiraslanov  suffers  from  epilepsy,  and  has  undergone  an  operation. <br/>Kazimov and Poladov have also undergone operations. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><b>87.

<b>G.  OTHER CASES </b><br/>
 <br/>
<i><b>a.  Case of those arrested in the Ismayilli protests  </b></i><br/>
<i><b> <br/></b></i>On  the  evening  of  23  January  2013,  the  administrator  of  the  Chirag  Hotel  located  in  the <br/>Ismayilli region, Emil Shamdinov, and his acquaintance Elmaddin Mammadov, crashed into <br/>the car of a local taxi driver, afterwards kicking the taxi driver. Both men were drunk at the <br/>time  of  the  incident.  The  hotel  was  owned  by  Vugar  Alakbarov,  son  of  former  Minister  of <br/>Labor and Social Protection, Fuzuli Alakbarov. (This was proven with documentation by Ilgar <br/>Mammadov, who was arrested for the same incident). During the incident, both men insulted <br/>Ismayilli residents who had gathered at the scene. This led to a protest by the residents. The <br/>angered residents started to throw stones at the Chirag Hotel and set it on fire. The protesters <br/>also demanded the resignation of Head of the Local Executive Authority Nizami Alakbarov, <br/>brother of former Minister Fuzuli Alakbarov, and continued the protest in front of his house <br/>as well. The protesters burnt the house and automobiles in its yard. To respond to the protests, <br/>a number of police officers and internal troops were brought to the region, and arrests began. <br/>A criminal case into the incident was opened. On 23 January, eight Ismayilli residents, along <br/>with Emil Shamdinov and Elmaddin Mammadov, received pre-trial detention sentences, and <br/>23  persons  received  administrative  detention  sentences  of  varying  terms.  On  24  January, <br/>protests continued with a demand for the resignation of the executive head and release of the <br/>arrested protesters. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters. <br/> <br/>A  total  of  eighteen  people  were  arrested  for  the  incident.  Sixteen  were  residents  of  the <br/>Ismayilli region. The other two arrested were Ilgar Mammadov, Chairman of the Republican <br/>Alternative movement, and journalist Tofig Yagublu, whose cases are detailed earlier in this <br/>report. Those who were sentenced to pre-trial detention were initially charged with resisting <br/>police and violating public order. However, the latter was replaced with a more serious charge <br/>– inciting mass unrest and participating in the unrest. <br/> <br/>Sheki Court of Grave Crimes Judge Rashid Huseynov issued ten of those arrested sentences <br/>of  four  to  eight  years  in  prison,  on  17  March  2014.  Eight  sentences  were  issued  with <br/>conditional  charges  and  the  detainees  were  released  from  the  court  hall.    Although  some  of <br/>the defendants pled partly guilty, others were arrested under false and ordered accusations. In <br/>addition to Ilgar Mammadov and Tofig Yagublu, there were residents of the Ismayilli region <br/>who  were  arrested  under  clearly  political  motives.  The  involvement  of  these  defendents  in <br/>criminal actions was not proven during the trial.  Even police officers testifying as witnesses <br/>said  that  they  had  not  seen  the  faces  of  those  who  set  the  fires,  and  that  general  protests <br/>including a number of residents were frequent. Although the owners and residents of the hotel <br/>were  recognized  as  victims,  they  said  in  the  trial  that  they  had  no  claims  against  the <br/>defendants. <br/> <br/> <br/><b>90.

Ibrahimov along with <br/>Elchin  Ismayilly,  a  journalist  living  in  Ismayilli,  had  made  public  on  ANS  TV  and  print <br/>media,  the  pressure  that  was  being  put  on  entrepreneurs  by  the  authorities,  such  as  power <br/>supplies being cut off for several days, and the closure of the shops owned by entrepreneurs, <br/>as well as various social problems. As a result, Ibrahimov became the target <br/>of  local  authorities.  On  the  first  day  of  the  mass  protests  (23  January)  in <br/>Ismayilli,  Ibrahimov  gave  an  interview  to  journalists  in  which  he  described <br/>the construction of the Chirag Hotel as illegal, and stated that 35 low-income <br/>families had been forced to leave the building so that it could be turned into a <br/>hotel. He criticized the local  executive institutions for their involvement.4542 <br/>In a part of his interview that was not aired, he blamed the Executive Head of <br/>the  Ismayilli  region  and  the  son  of  the  Minister  of  Labor  and  Social <br/>Protection in these incidents. <br/> <br/>Ibrahimov  was  not  directly  involved  in  the  protests  and  confrontation.  He  was  arrested  one <br/>month after the protests due to the intensive efforts of the local executive authorities. Charges <br/>were brought against him. <i><b>Sheki Court of Grave Crimes sentenced Ibrahimov to eight years <br/>in jail on 17 March 2014. <br/></b></i> <br/> <br/><b>91.

<b>Case  background:</b>  Elshan  Ismayilli  is  a  member  of  the  Ismayilli  regional  branch  of  the <br/>Azerbaijan  Popular  Front  Party,  and  brother  of  journalist  Elchin  Ismayilli,  who  cooperates <br/>with the opposition <i>Azadliq</i> newspaper and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The journalist <br/>became a target of the local executive authorities for his long-standing coverage of problems <br/>in  Ismayilli and the neighboring regions.  Ismayilli and his  relatives received several  threats. <br/>

 <br/>
In  addition,  it  was  he  who  spread  information  through  social  media  networks  about  the <br/>Ismayilli protests, disseminating photos and videos. <br/> <br/>Elshan  Ismayilli  was  threatened  several  times  by  the  Deputy  Head  of  the  Local  Executive <br/>Authority, Rafael Ahmadov, that he would face trouble. Specifically, Ismayilli had been filing <br/>complaints  about  the  roads,  water,  electricity  and  other  social  problems  of  the  Hajihatamli <br/>village where he lived, and provided this information to his brother, the journalist. <br/>Elshan  Ismayilli  was  not  at  the  scene  of  the  mass  protests  in  Ismayilli  on  the  first  day,  23 <br/>January. He was in the Hajihatamli village, which was 34 kilometers away from the center of <br/>the region. On 24 January, Ismayilli came to the center of the region with his parents to attend <br/>the mourning ceremony for his late grandfather, Khalil Khalilov. The ceremony took place on <br/>M. F. Akhundov Street, the scene of the mass protests. Ismayilli was among the people who <br/>came to the scene out of curiosity.  <br/> <br/>At the scene of the protest, Deputy Head of the Local Executive Authority Rafael Ahmadov <br/>rapidly approached Ismayilli, insulting him and saying, “you organized these incidents.” The <br/>video provided by the investigation shows that Ismayilli, whose face was  clear in the video, <br/>did not commit any illegal action, and was merely observing developments. Nonetheless, he <br/>was arrested ten days later. On 3 February, police brought him to the center of the region from <br/>the  village  and  questioned  him  at  the  Regional  Police  Department.  Ismayilli  was  also <br/>questioned  by  the  Deputy  Police  Chief  of  the  region,  Shohrat  Karimov.  Ismayilli  was  later <br/>questioned  at  the  Regional  Prosecutor’s  Office.  On  4  February,  he  was  released  on  the <br/>condition that he return to the prosecutor’s office. At about 1 pm on 4 February, Ismayilli was <br/>sent in a car to Baku, where he was arrested. <i><b>Sheki Court of Grave Crimes sentenced Elshan <br/>Ismayilli to five years and six months in jail on 17 March 2014. </b></i><br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<b>Case  background:  </b>Insanov is considered one of the founders of the ruling New Azerbaijan <br/>Party  (YAP).  He  served  as  the  Minister  of  Health  from  1993  to  the  time  of  his  arrest.  At  a <br/>meeting  of  the  YAP  Management  Board  ahead  of  the  parliamentary  elections  in  November <br/>2005,  Insanov  voiced  severely  critical  opinions  saying  that  there  were  criminals  in  the <br/>government,  and  that  incorrect  policies  being  pursued  needed  to  be  changed,  otherwise  the <br/>government would be deceiving the people. In the meeting of the Management Board before <br/>the YAP Congress, Insanov continued voicing his critical opinions, saying that he was almost <br/>being made to apologize for mistakes made and incorrect policies pursued by those  Insanov <br/>had invited to join the party.  <br/> <br/>Seven  months  prior  to  his  arrest,  in  March  2005,  Insanov  applied  to  President  Aliyev, <br/>requesting  to  resign  from  his  position  as  the  Minister  of  Health,  and  also  from  the  ruling <br/>party. But his resignation was not approved. Two months before his arrest, Insanov stated that <br/>he  was  being  followed.  He  believed  he  was  even  being  followed  upon  his  departure  from <br/>Baku, and appealed to the President with respect to this matter. In his appeal, Insanov stated <br/>that he was being followed by groups within the government. <br/> <br/>Insanov  was  arrested  sixteen  days  before  the  2005  parliamentary  elections  and  initially <br/>charged  with  plotting  a  coup,  although  he  was  later  convicted  of  economic  crimes.  He  was <br/>arrested  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Security  and  immediately  sentenced  to  pre-trial <br/>detention. The former minister stated that he was subjected to torture at the time of his arrest, <br/>and that the torture continued in Bayil Prison, in Investigative Prison No.5, and in Prison No. <br/>13. <br/> <br/>

 <br/>
The investigation into the criminal case against Insanov was finalized in 2007, but his lawyers <br/>were  not  allowed  to  study  and  copy  the  case  materials.  <i><b>Insanov  was  sentenced  to  eleven <br/>years  in  jail  by  the  Baku  Court  of  Grave  Crimes  on  20  April  2007.</b></i>  The  Baku  Court  of <br/>Appeals upheld the ruling on 21 September 2007, and the Supreme Court upheld the ruling on <br/>16 January 2008.  <br/> <br/>Regarding the economic crimes charges against Insanov, there were considerable differences <br/>between  the  amount  of  the  misappropriated  funds  claimed  in  the  case  materials,  and  the <br/>amount  stated  in  the  information  publicized  by  the  Prosecutor  General’s  Office.  Insanov <br/>provided  the  court  with  receipts  evidencing  his  payment  of  taxes,  including  payment  of <br/>85,000  AZN  in  taxes  in  2005.  Charged  with  illegal  privatization,  Insanov  stated  that  this <br/>process was implemented by former Minister of Economic Development Farhad Aliyev, and <br/>the Head of the State Committee for Property Issues, Karam Hasanov. Insanov filed a motion <br/>requesting  that  these  persons  testify  in  the  trial.  The  motion  was  not  granted.  In  addition,  a <br/>significant  portion  of  Insanov’s  testimony  given  on  the  day  of  his  arrest  was  lost,  and <br/>therefore not included with the case materials. <br/> <br/>Insanov  applied  to  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  (ECHR)  under <br/>Article  3  (prohibition  of  torture)  and  Article  6  (right  to  a  fair  trial)  of  the <br/>European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On 14 <br/>March  2013,  the  ECHR  recognized  the  violation  of  both  rights. 46  The <br/>Court ruled that the former minister’s right for defense and other procedure <br/>rules  were  violated  and  that  there  was  a  need  for  additional  investigation.  The  ordered  the <br/>Azerbaijani government to pay a fine of 10,000 AZN.  <br/> <br/>Based  on  the  ECHR  ruling,  on  15  November  2013,  the  SupremAzerbaijani  e  Court, <br/>transferred  the  case  to  the  Baku  Court  of  Appeals  for  reconsideration.  During  the  appellate <br/>hearing,  Insanov  voiced  severely  critical  opinions  against  the  government,  particularly <br/>President  Aliyev.  During  the  next  trial  session,  Insanov  was  held  in  a  glass  cage,  and  the <br/>judge did not allow him to speak (the judge turned off his microphone while he was voicing <br/>critical opinions). On 25 February 2014, the Court of Appeals upheld the eleven-year prison <br/>sentence.  <br/> <br/>PACE Resolution #1545 of 2007 called for a fair trial for Ali Insanov.47 A report released by <br/>former PACE  co-rapporteurs for Azerbaijan Andres Herkel and Evguenia Jivkova in  March <br/>2008,  and  a  PACE  resolution  of  24  July  2008,  also  include  points  of  concern  related  to <br/>Insanov’s case.  <br/> <br/><b>93.

<b>Case background: </b>Nigat Guliyev served as the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations from <br/>1993 to 1995. He later moved to Adjara, an autonomous republic in Georgia, where he served <br/>as  the  advisor  to  Aslan  Abashidze,  President  of  Adjara,  until  2004.  He  then  returned  to <br/>Azerbaijan and was engaged in business in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Guliyev was arrested on <br/>19  October  2005,  shortly  before  the  November  parliamentary  elections.  Although  charged <br/>with attempting a coup, he was released shortly thereafter.  <br/> <br/>Two  months  before  October  2013  presidential  election,  Guliyev  was  arrested  again  by  the <br/>Ministry of National Security at his cottage in the Absheron region. Before his arrest, he had a <br/>phone  conversation  with  well-known  film  director  Rustam  Ibragimbekov,  the  United <br/>Opposition presidential candidate, and expressed his support to Ibragimbekov, who had been <br/>subject to repression. In his interviews, Ibragimbekov stated that he had known Guliyev for a <br/>long time and that he thought Guliyev had been arrested for calling and talking to him. <br/> <br/>Guliyev’s house was also searched. His wife was unable to control the actions of those who <br/>entered  the  cottage.  The  family’s  mobile  phones  were  seized  and  they  were  banned  from <br/>leaving the house. Without explaining the reason for the search, Ministry of National Security <br/>employees  confiscated  Guliyev’s  documents,  computers,  photo  and  video  materials,  and  an <br/>iron safe. It was claimed that arms were found outside the cottage and in a vehicle owned by <br/>Guliyev. <br/> <br/>Immediately after his arrest, Guliyev’s requests for access to a lawyer, and to call home, were <br/>denied.  Guliyev’s  presence  during  the  car  search  was  not  ensured.  After  his  arrest,  the  car <br/>remained under the control of the Ministry of National Security. Guliyev refused to testify in <br/>court, due to the false nature of the charge against him. <i>Nijat</i><b> <i>Guliyev was sentenced to three <br/>years in jail by the Absheron District Court on 2 April 2014 – the full sentence requested by <br/>the prosecutor.</i></b> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><b>94. Asif Aydın oglu Latifov <br/></b> <br/><b>Date of arrest: </b>29 August 2012 <br/> <br/><b>Charges:  </b>Criminal  Code  Articles  228.1  (Illegal  purchase,  transfer,  sale,  storage, <br/>transportation or carrying of  firearms, accessories, supplies (except  for smooth-bore hunting <br/>weapons  and  ammunition  to  it),  or  explosives)  and  232.1  (Plunder  or  extortion  of  firearms, <br/>accessories, supplies, or explosives)  <br/> <br/><b>Place of detention: </b>Prison No. 9 <br/> <br/><b>Case  background:</b>  Asif  Latifov  was  an  officer  at  the  State  Special  Guard  Service  (SSGS), <br/>which  is  responsible  for  the  protection  of  the  president.  Latifov  served  in  the  so-called <br/>“Special Purpose  Beta  Group.” On 5 March 2011, Emin Alakbarov, with <br/>whom Latifov was serving at the airport, lost his gun cartridge, which was <br/>found by Latifov. Because he and Fikrat Rzayev, head of the Beta Group, <br/>were  at  odds with  each  other,  Latifov turned in  the cartridge to  the SSGS <br/>Inspection Organization Office. Four days later, he was dismissed from his <br/>job, and accused of Article 156 (Non-compliance in service). The ongoing <br/>conflict between Latifov and Rzayev had arisen as Latifov protested illegal <br/>activities  in  the  SSGS,  particularly  the  illegal  affairs  of  Rzayev  himself. <br/>

 <br/>
Rzayev reportedly demanded 30 AZN per month from members of the Beta Group. In protest, <br/>Latifov  had  complained  to  the  SSGS  Inspection  Organization  Office.  Disappointed  with  his <br/>dismissal,  Latifov  started  to  publicize  both  this  problem  and  other  illegal  affairs.  He  gave <br/>interviews  and  published  articles  with  opposition  and  independent  newspapers.  He  held <br/>several public press conferences. He also sued SSGS management. <br/> <br/>Despite several warnings, Latifov did not stop publically criticizing SSGS management. As a <br/>result,  one  year  and  three  months  after  he  found  the  lost  cartridge,  this  matter  was  used <br/>against him. Specifically, he was charged with deliberately stealing the cartridge and abusing <br/>power. A criminal case was opened by the Military Prosecutor’s Office. <br/> <br/><i><b>Latifov was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison under a decision issued by Baku Military Court <br/>on  28  January  2013.  On  17  July  2013,  Baku  Court  of  Appeals  Judge  Jamal  Ramazanov <br/>upheld  the  verdict  without  any  change.  However,  Supreme  Court  Judge  Ingilab  Nasirov <br/>later reduced Latifov’s sentence to 4.5 years. </b></i><br/>
 <br/>
None of the witnesses questioned during the trial could prove that Latifov stole the cartridge. <br/>They said that they believed Latifov had stolen the cartridge, claiming that it was impossible <br/>for the cartridge to disappear otherwise. In general, no evidence proving the fact of theft was <br/>uncovered  during  the  investigation  or  the  trial.  The  sentence  was  based  on  the  witness <br/>testimonies of those who wanted Latifov’s arrested, and would not want to lose their job at <br/>the SSGS. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/><b>95. Akif Shamsaddin oglu  Muradverdiyev   <br/></b> <br/><b>Date of arrest: </b>20 June 2013 <br/> <br/><b>Charge: </b>Criminal Code Article 206.1 (Smuggling, that is, moving goods or <br/>other  objects  through  a  customs  border  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic, <br/>committed  without  or  with  concealment  from  the  customs  control  or  with <br/>use  of  false  documents  or  means  of  customs  identification,  or  connected <br/>with undeclared or doubtful declaring) <br/> <br/><b>Place of detention: </b>Treatment Institution of the Justice Ministry  <br/><b> <br/>Case  background:</b>  Akif  Muradverdiyev  was  the  former  Head  of  Service  of  the  President’s <br/>Office.  In  1995  he  was  a  Member  of  Parliament.  In  the  early  hours  of  20  June  2013, <br/>Muradverdiyev was about to leave for Moscow, as he passed through the security check at the <br/>airport, as well as the customs checkpoint and border checkpoint. But when he went to board <br/>the  plane,  a  plain-clothed  person  approached  him,  gently  asking  him  “to  slow  down,”  and <br/>took  Muradverdiyev to  a room where he was asked to  hand over his  bag  upon entering. He <br/>was then invited into the room, where a conversation took place. Later Muradverdiyev’s bag <br/>was  brought  into  the  room,  and  he  was  asked  what  was  in  the  bag.  He  answered  that  1400 <br/>USD, 900 AZN, a bankcard, and clothes were in the bag. The bag was opened and he was told <br/>that  a  package  with  gold  bars  was  found.  Charged  with  smuggling,  Muradverdiyev  was <br/>sentenced to pre-trial detention. It later emerged that the gold was planted by the Ministry of <br/>National Security. <br/> <br/>

 <br/>
Muradverdiyev  stated  that  he  was  arrested  because  of  the  belief  that  he  would  meet  with <br/>United  Opposition  Presidential  Candidate  Ibragimbekov,  who  lives  in  Moscow. <br/>Muradverdiyev described the claim as nonsense and denied any connection to Ibrahimbekov. <br/> <br/><i><b>Muradverdiyev  was  sentenced  to  four  years  in  jail  by  the  Khazar  District  Court  on  13 <br/>December 2013.</b></i> The Baku Court of Appeals upheld the ruling on 12 February 2014. The trial <br/>did not investigate the source of the banned gold bars found in Muradverdiyev’s bag, or how <br/>the  bars  were  obtained.  Muradverdiyev  had  already  been  checked  when  entering  the  airport <br/>with  the  same  bag,  and  later  was  subjected  to  an  in-depth  examination  by  customs  and <br/>security employees, who found nothing prohibited in the bag. The court refused to investigate <br/>this issue as well. The testimonies of the Minstry of National Security officers who claimed to <br/>have  found  the  gold  bars  during  the  search  were  considered  sufficient  to  issue  a  prison <br/>sentence. <br/> <br/>Muradverdiyev was previously arrested in October 2005 charged with attempting the violent <br/>capture of power and preparing for mass unrest; however, this charge was later replaced with <br/>misappropriation  of  state  funds  and  abuse  of  power.  Consequently,  he  was  sentenced  to  six <br/>years  in  jail.  The  upper  court  later  reduced  this  period  to  five  years. <br/>Muradverdiyev  was  released  on  15  January  2008,  as  his  prison  sentence <br/>was  converted  to  a  conditional  sentence  because  of  his  serious  health <br/>problems. Muradverdiyev applied to the European Court of Human Rights <br/>(ECtHR) with respect to this period of imprisonment. The ECtHR ruled that <br/>his right to a fair trial was violated.48 <br/> <br/>Muradverdiyev  is  currently  being  held  in  the  Treatment  Institution  of  the <br/>Ministry of Justice, due to problems with his health, which have worsened. <br/>Two gaps have emerged in his spine, and he has a pancreatic ulcer.  <br/>

He ran for parliament in the 2010 <br/>elections, and later stated that the elections had been falsified. <br/> <br/>Panahli was arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by Eldaniz Rzayev, who bought a car <br/>from  Panahli.  Rzayev  claimed  that  he  was  beaten  by  Panahli  and  his  friend  Jeyhun <br/>Ferzullayev for criticizing them over a mechanical issue with the car. He also claimed that he <br/>was  beaten  with  an  iron  tool.  At  the  time  of  his  arrest,  police  searched  Panahli’s  house  for <br/>weapons.  However,  instead  of  weapons,  they  confiscated  Panahli’s  archives,  including <br/>documents, discs, computers and USB memory sticks. <br/>                                                 <br/><a href="http://bit.ly/1dUqnw3">48 http://bit.ly/1dUqnw3 </a><br/>

<i><b> <br/>On  17  June  2011,  Nasimi  District  Court  sentenced  Panahli  to  six  years  in  jail</b></i>,  and <br/>Ferzullayev to  four  years.  The Baku Court of Appeals  upheld  the decision on 14 November <br/>2011, and the Supreme Court did the same on 20 June 2012. Feyzullayev was released under <br/>a pardon decree issued on 26 December 2012. <br/> <br/>There  were  serious  contradictions  in  the  testimonies  of  the  complainant  during  the <br/>investigation  and  in  the  trial.  Eight  people  working  in  the  area  where  the  incident  allegedly <br/>took place were involved in the trial as witnesses. Seven of them said that they had not seen <br/>any fight or an injured person. Only one said that Panahli caught Rzayev by the hair, pushed <br/>him to the ground, and beat him. However, the alleged victim was bald. <br/> <br/>Following his transfer to prison No. 17, Panahli was subjected to pressure for assisting other <br/>prisoners  in  voicing  their  complaints.  He  was  repeatedly  taken  to  solitary  confinement,  and <br/>several  times  went  on  hunger  strike  to  protest.  As  a  result,  Arif  Mirzayev,  then  Chief  of <br/>Prison No.17, appealed to the court requesting Panahli’s transfer to Gobustan Prison, which <br/>has  horrible  detention  conditions.  Although  the  appeal  claimed  that  Panahli  had  repeatedly <br/>violated rules of discipline and order in prison, it did not offer any notable evidence. On 25 <br/>February  2013,  the  Khazar  District  Court  issued  a  decision  to  transfer  Panahli  to  Gobustan. <br/>The decision was  executed after the  Baku Court  of Appeals  upheld  the decision on 14 June <br/>2013. <br/>

Seyidov  was  a  former  Deputy  Chief  of  the  Yasamal  branch  of  ”Texnikabank.” <br/>When  he  was  arrested  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Security,  Seyidov  was  initially  charged <br/>with fraud. But later the charge was made more severe. Despite the fact that nine months had <br/>passed since Seyidov’s arrest, necessary investigative measures had not been taken. His pre-<br/>trial  detention  was  extended,  although  extension  of  pre-trial  detention  for  a  crime  can  take <br/>place in exceptional cases. <br/> <br/>According  to  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  it  is  up  to  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  to <br/>implement  investigative  actions  on  fraud  charge.  But  the  law  was  violated  with  respect  to <br/>Seyidov’s  arrest,  since  he  was  arrested  by  the  Ministry  of  National  Security,  held  in  their <br/>detention center, and the investigation was carried out by the Ministry. <br/> <br/>Seyidov was arrested twenty days after the arrest of the Texnikabank’s Management Board, <br/>Etibar Aliyev, among others. Seyidov was arrested in connection with the same criminal case. <br/>Officially,  Seyidov  was  charged  with  violating  the  law  under  the  instruction  of  and  in  the <br/>favor of the bank’s management. Aliyev, as well as other employees of the bank, have since <br/>been released, whereas Seyidov still remains in prison. <br/> <br/>Seyidov  suffers  from  multiple  sclerosis,  for  which  there  are  supporting  statements  of <br/>independent and private medical institutions. It is reprehensible to hold someone suffering in <br/>this way in closed detention. There is also the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan of 7 March <br/>2012, on state care for patients of multiple sclerosis. The law envisages several measures to <br/>take care of and protect these patients. One of these measures is the release of these patients <br/>from prison. But Seyidov, who suffers from this disease, is still in held in prison.  <br/>
